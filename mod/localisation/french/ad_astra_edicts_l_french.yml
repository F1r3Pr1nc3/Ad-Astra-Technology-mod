 artifact_shard_autopsy: "Shard Autopsy"
 artifact_shard_autopsy_desc: "The colossal creature known as Shard was a voracious and equally dangerous creature - her defeat a lengthy and difficult effort. Now defeated, however, her body can be analysed from one end to the other to uncover the secrets of her species - a form of the 'Ether Drake' species.\n\nThe problem is, a lot of the data we have is incomplete or worse - faulty as a result of battle damage. But piecing together the data with what we've gathered from Precursor data, we are on the cusp of a potential major breakthrough."

 edict_crystalline_arsenal_reinforcement: "Crystalline Arsenal Reinforcement"
 edict_crystalline_arsenal_reinforcement_desc: "§LThe rare crystals our empire employs are incredibly useful for a wide range of purposes - but when employed in energy weapons, the crystals are incredibly efficient at focusing energy beams and bolts as well as serving as ultra-high energy capacitors and, in some cases, as armor-reinforcement.\n\nThey are also quite useful when employed in sensor technology, the result is an exponential efficiency increase in many sensor systems, allowing for significantly improved Point-Defense Systems and Early Warning Units.§!"
 edict_deploy_worldbreaker_ordnance_campaign: "Deploy Worldbreaker Ordnance"
 edict_deploy_worldbreaker_ordnance_campaign_desc: "§LRestraint is folly, madness even. When one commits to war, there cannot be half-measures.\n\nThe employment of crust-piercer warheads able to peel the crust off planets, chemical reactant warheads able to turn oceans into boiling acid and burning fog, self-destructing biological warheads that can turn continents of biological matter into vast expanses of polymers and extremely volatile gas, gravitic warheads able to trigger supervolcano eruptions and cataclysmic earthquakes among many, many other weapons shall be the tools we employ in our arsenal along the very fullest extent of our ship weaponry.\n\nBy the time the guns fall silent ... nothing but ashes and silence will remain.§!"

 edict_enhanced_deep_space_transport_networks_desc: "§LResources are required in every corner of the collective's general reach - foremost Drones and necessary resources for various specialized tasks.

 edict_exotic_arsenal_reinforcement: "Exotic Arsenal Reinforcement"
 edict_exotic_arsenal_reinforcement_desc: "§LExotic Gases are quite effective for boosting the performance of shields, even in atmosphere by creating complex dampening fields, and also works well to create superior missile and aerospace craft thrusters. Adapting the former into munitions means concentrating more of the force of munitions and blasts into high-efficiency shape-charges ... or enclose a target in a shield bubble to vastly increase the effect of a warhead.\n\nAnd as with ships, some of the exotic gases we utilize can be employed to boost shield capabilities of every type of ground unit, resulting in dramatic increase of general survivability. These rather complex dampening fields are dependent on the technology they utilize, but can repel or at least blunt enemy attacks.§!"
 edict_living_metal_architecture: "Living Metal Architecture"

 edict_living_metal_arsenal_reinforcement: "Living Metal Arsenal Reinforcement"
 edict_living_metal_arsenal_reinforcement_desc: "§LLiving Metal is an incredibly durable material and extremely useful for a wide range of different purposes. Because the material exhibits a form of shape memory without requiring energy input, it has a vast range of different applications, in particular when it comes to military technologies.\n\nThe most obvious is armour plating that can rapidly 'regenerate' from damage and weapons that can handle greater stresses for much longer periods of time with far less maintenance required, but also many components in the logistical arm of every army can make use of the material.\n\nSomething as simple as a powertool that never requires far less maintenance reduces many requirements drastically - but also many types of pipes and reactor systems benefit greatly from the use of the alloy, which allows for them to run much longer without the need for maintenance cycles.\n\nIn all, the alloy has so many applications that were it not for its scarcity, it would represent a quantum leap forward in terms of maintenance.§!"

 edict_psi_forged_arsenal_reinforcement: "Psi-Forged Arsenal Reinforcement"
 edict_psi_forged_arsenal_reinforcement_desc: "§LOnce Zro-infused materials and circuitry turns from relatively niche to standard for all, creating advanced and more powerful variations of psi-alloys becomes the next logical step.

 edict_volatile_arsenal_reinforcement: "Volatile Arsenal Reinforcement"
 edict_volatile_arsenal_reinforcement_desc: "§LKinetic Weapons are every bit as effective in an age of mass drivers as they were in the age where they required exothermic reactions. Adding volatile motes to specialized ammunition and missiles just happens to make them significantly more devastating.\n\nLikewise, thin layers of Volatile Motes on the hulls of our combat vehicles to serve as reactive components allow them to withstand significantly more powerful kinetic impacts through controlled counter-explosions. Adding it to anything smaller, while certainly possible, has its disadvantages in other ways.§!"

 tech_localized_paraterraforming_desc: "The sheer, monumental hostility of many worlds goes without saying, resulting in a significant drain of resources to keep the colony relatively habitable. While many new technologies have helped significantly in this matter, there remains room for improvement still.\n\nEncasing entire districts - or at least parts of them - in gargantuan domes to protect them from the external environment helps immensely against the external environments on some worlds; the concept is hardly new, but doing it on a much larger scale and at the same time addressing the sheer scale of issues that come with it - heat build-up, emissions build-ups and the danger of parts of the dome falling that can hit with the force of an Assault Weapon discharge all add up to new solutions being needed to eliminate them all as problems."
