Its very location is a mystery that makes no coherent sense - scan its previous location and it is detected in a new one. Scan the new one and it appears in another, random location. The Alpha Fortress is known, however ... somehow.\n\nRising high into the stratospheric altitudes and even touching the very edges of the equivalent of a mesosphere on this world, the Alpha Fortress is a gigantic mountain tower that veils colossal arrays of hidden weapons, shield generators and outright bizarre armour defences that seem to defy the very laws of physics itself. But what makes the Fortress so dangerous is what goes on inside it ... whatever that may be.\n\nIt continually monitors and augments the forces that are stationed on this world and indeed, across the entire empire in question. Adjustments to armour, shields, weapons, tactics, strategies, logistics and designs. The very extent is a mystery. What isn't - is its effects that holds it as a whole.\n\nReasonably speaking, the best recourse when engaging the Alpha Fortress is not to attack it head on, but rather to shatter the planet it rests upon ... and hope that it doesn't reappear somewhere else.\n\n§YAllows building special armies from this world with corresponding technology.§!"

While this titanic fortress stretches far into the stratosphere and nearly to the edge of the mesosphere of the Ecumenopolis, the true bulk of the fortress is buried deep into the world with only a small portion of it visible from orbit.\n\nThe part that does rise above, however, is constructed from starship grade composites, arrayed with massive shield generators, gargantuan hangar bays, launch facilities, point-defence grids, anti-orbital interception grids, passive sensor array grids, rapid repair and deployment facilities, command and control facilities and barracks and emergency response facilities of every kind.\n\nAny force that wants to secure the Ecumenopolis for themselves will have to challenge the Citadel. A task easier said than done."

 building_starlift_foundry_desc: "Visible far and wide - even easily from orbit - the Starlift Foundry is a tower of gargantuan proportions, reaching far into the stratosphere and very nearly touching the mesosphere equivalent of the Ecumenopolis. From its myriad launch pads and landing bays, entire pre-spaceflight continents worth of materiel leave and arrive to the Foundry each standard day.\n\nThe Foundry extends far beyond its visible parts, however. Deep down, the Foundry extends down to mantle depths for extraction and further expansion - and high above, either around the local star or around nearby stars, the Foundry controls massive arrays of continent-sized satellites that draw energy and matter from the stars to gradually convert into a vast range of usable elements.\n\nTo further production to even greater heights, the core facilities of the Foundry - habitat facilities, manufacturing plants, hangars, law enforcement and military defence facilities in addition to research and development facilities - all coordinate to a lesser or greater extent the greater industrial network of the system, making the facility a key piece in the greater logistical network."

 building_vault_city_desc: "Rising high above the world below - an artificial mountain range of composites, secure pathways, checkpoints, point-defence grids and massive environmental protection systems marks this as the Vault City - a set of arcologies that are tied together to form a bunker city that offers some of the best shelter possible for its inhabitants against the harsh conditions outside, while also acting as a home base for research and salvage teams that travel out into the wasteland.\n\nConstructed specifically to counter the inherent threats of Tomb Worlds - extremely elevated radiation, sooty aerosols, gargantuan dust storms and little to no sunlight - the Vault City is a completely self-enclosed system that is effectively one gigantic bunker with its own hydroponics facilities, barracks and habitat facilities. It isn't comfortable by any stretch of the imagination - but it's considered better than irradiated wasteland."

Literally spanning the entire world in question from one end to the other, the Engine is interwoven with the world on every single layer through a continual network of outposts, nodes and what appears to be roots - blending so seamlessly into the world that none can tell where the Engine begins and the world end ... and vice versa.\n\nIt keeps the world spinning. Perhaps literally."

 building_wyrmguard_citadel_desc: "The Citadel of Wyrmguard. This gigantic arcology - rising high into the world's equivalent of a stratosphere and touching the very edges of its mesosphere - is by far one of the largest buildings of this world; a mountain of starship grade armour and shields, bristling from its base to its peaks with point-defence weaponry, anti-orbital interception cannons, artillery and hangars large enough to house Corvettes.\n\nThose same hangars now serve as the habitats of the greatest weapon this gargantuan fortress has, however - the Wyrmguard. The Drakes and their companions alongside strike units of Gene-Warriors patrol the skies of this world from the Citadel in large aerospace carriers or atop the backs of the great Drakes.\n\nIn the Citadel itself, training facilities, command centres, habitat facilities, bleeding edge support facilities, research laboratories of every kind and manufacturing facilities that produce some of the most high quality equipment the empire can afford make up the core of the Citadel - in addition to perfecting the tactics, doctrines and training behind them; gradually improving upon everything from weapons, shields, armour technologies to tactics, strategies, logistics and overall designs over time.\n\nIn order to engage the Wyrmguard Citadel - the only effective recourse is to shatter the world it rests upon.

We can do much more. Go much further. By implementing Xenomorph strands with advanced cybernetics and new generations of genetic augmentations in addition to cladding them in powerful armour frameworks, a new generation of xenomorph is created that are supremely efficient in their tasks - the Reaver.\n\nThere are researchers who argue against the implementation of these new creations, stating that their release could be potentially disastrous.

 tech_panoptica_systems_desc: "There are worlds under our governance that are awash in crime and unrest - full of those that have deserved their place there. To that end, there must be a final, complete solution to ensuring that their stay is as ironclad as possible. Our researchers may have a solution to this - a new solution of obtaining power of mind over mind in a quantity so far without equal on this scale.\n\nA boot to keep criminals where they belong and a mill to grind rogues honest."

 tech_paradise_engineering_desc: "Resort Worlds are - as their name implies - places of refuge and respite for many of our empire's citizens. Yet there is potential to create something unique with these worlds; something worthy of its name."
 tech_psi_forge_technologies: "Psi-Forge Technologies"
 tech_psi_forge_technologies_desc: "The power of our minds span far and wide - as does the power of our technology. While each have their limits, their flaws - there is a power to both realms. In theory, the same technology with which we forged our Precognition Interfaces can be expanded upon significantly - to create an entirely new form of technology; Psionic in nature but with all the power technology can muster."
 tech_social_megahubs: "Social Megahubs"
 tech_social_megahubs_desc: "The Hypercomms Forum offered us many new possibilities, but with the increase in communication, there have been increasing needs to satisfy needs across our empire. At the same time, economic theorems suggest that a large scale project that acts as a focal point for socio-economic structures on the planet - in essence, a massive hub dedicated to satisfying the needs of our people - could offer major political, economic and social opportunities."
 tech_starlift_operations: "Starlifting Operations"
 tech_starlift_operations_desc: "Contrary to the general belief of many pre-FTL civilizations, the vast majority of building materials in a starsystem are not found in the planets or the asteroids - but rather, the supermajority is located inside the most inhospitable place possible; the star or stars of a system - with a regular G-type Main Sequence Star (Yellow Dwarf) having more Carbon and Iron than an entire planet's combined mass several hundred times over and its energy a resource in itself for particle accelerators to synthetize heavier elements.\n\nIn essence, Starlifting - a technique to extract material from a star - means an effectively inexhaustible supply of raw basic materials on level with literally building entire worlds and still having enough to build several hundred more from a single star.\n\nThe biggest problem in this equation, however, is energy - our starbases can already handle the proximity to a star fairly well, but extracting raw materials from a star in bulk is quite another challenge altogether, needing virtually every field of engineering to step up twice over. It will be difficult to pull off - but success equates virtually unlimited resources for billions of years to come."
 tech_streamlined_megaproduction: "Streamlined Mega-Production"
 tech_streamlined_megaproduction_desc: "Since the earliest days of our exploration of the galaxy, mining into the mantles of worlds and has been one of the most common - and quite profitable - ventures outside asteroid mining to ensure a steady and easy supply of raw minerals for our empire. Yet we have come to hit a fundamental issue that was in a way, unforeseen in our ventures: an optimized logistics network.\n\nSpecifically, the issue lies in that while off-world logistics are quite easily handled by the system starbase, on and off-world logistics are hampered by the fact that SSTO technology has specific limitations in terms of bulk transportation, meaning a lot of resources already processed end up in storage until they can be transported off-world.\n\nTogether with a proposal to enhance our near-core mining technology, engineers and logisticians have proposed an all-encompassing solution to these specific sets of problems in the form of a dedicated Mining and Logistics Facility - the Tectonic Foundry."
 tech_the_celestial_beacons: "The Celestial Beacons"
 tech_the_celestial_beacons_desc: "Many are the years since we arose from our world of origin - and now, we stand among the stars as one of the brightest beacons of faith in the history of the galaxy. And with the finalization of our incredible achievement we now have to rise to new and unprecedented heights to match.\n\nScholars and clerics have pondered the idea for a long time of a new, grand temple - one of immense stature that outstrip all but a few. These temples must be on a scale to match that of the greater Ecumenopolis they are meant to rest upon. In other words - a temple that is, in itself ... a grand beacon to light the way of faith for as long as our civilization stands; and possibly, beyond."
 tech_the_colonial_agency: "The Colonial Agency"
 tech_the_colonial_agency_desc: "Since the very beginning of our ascent to the stars, our colonies have been - to a lesser or greater extent - experimentation in the ways of how to successfully establish a long-term foothold on a new, potentially hostile world. Everything from buildings to crops to medicine and environmental systems have had to be continually challenged by new and often unique conditions.\n\nDuring this time, most of the work was done by local administrations or even from the capitol of our empire - individual cadres of analysts, commanders and researchers working on a world-by-world basis to form new support structures where there had been none to really speak of; but never was there a true, dedicated structure to improve upon the existing structures without creating increased logistical loads of all kinds.\n\nTo that end, our researchers have in conjunction with our most senior commanders, colonial experts and analysts formulated a plan for a new organization - simply referred to as the 'Colonial Agency '- that is tasked with supporting the local governmental structure in a myriad of ways, gradually replacing or integrating the older structure with one far more well-equipped and organized."
 tech_the_infinity_network: "The Infinity Network"
 tech_the_infinity_network_desc: "During the more intense research into the Cynosural Realm, our researchers have made significant headway into strengthening the link to the strange realm - specifically, with the aid of the 'Ghosts' in the realm that are open to communicating with us, we have managed to develop a strange new form of material to create a powerful 'relay' that allow us to tap into the network with far greater efficiency and to a far greater extent.\n\nThe key issue, however, with these 'Cynosural Beacons' as they are called, is that they require an enormous amount of space and resources. Not to maintain - but simply to control the sheer flow of information that pours out, as well as decrypting it effectively.\n\nThe latest breakthroughs in macro-scale engineering, however, have changed that significantly. Now we stand on the cusp of a new advent in research - as we prepare to delve into the depths of the Infinity Network."
 tech_unified_research_networks: "Unified Research Networks"
 tech_unified_research_networks_desc: "Since the rise of our empire towards the stars, we have come to encounter a plethora of new phenomena and anomalies that has - in the short time relatively speaking since - pushed our understanding of the universe to unimaginable heights. But as we expand ever further, there have been strange new findings - specifically, a form of 'web', 'weave' or 'network' of deeply connected Dark Matter and possibly even Dark Energy.\n\nCalling it 'The Infinity Network' or 'The Cynosural Realm' - this network exists in a form that we cannot properly describe, seemingly connecting together through Dark Matter, Dark Energy and dimensional layers previously unknown to us, potentially forming an entirely seperate dimension altogether. The network might even span the entire universe, but we have no certain way of knowing.\n\nWhat we do know is that the 'network' isn't empty - it is full of strange entities, powerful and intelligent beyond the ability of even our greatest minds to understand. Most are aloof, completely uncaring of our comings and goings - yet a few are communicative and open to us ... albeit in their own strange ways.\n\nThese 'ghosts' as they are dubbed by us allow us to tap into the network, albeit to a very limited extent; though in order to understand the data we collect, however limited, we require new and far more advanced facilities. To that end, our researchers have developed a new type of arcological megafacility to fulfill many needs at once. It is referred to as the Grand Academy."
 tech_universal_forum: "Universal Forum"
 tech_universal_forum_desc: "The development of the Planetary Forum has been a resounding success overall. But as we have analysed the performance of the forums - their perks and their flaws - our research teams overviewed our latest major breakthroughs in technology in the same turn.\n\nSpecifically, they have devised plans for new generations of Planetary Forums - but on a size range that is exponentially larger. They refer to the plan as the Universal Forum."

 tech_wyrmguard: "Wyrmguard"
 tech_wyrmguard_desc: "We hold in our possession the genetic code for the Ether Drake. Some claim it madness, that we cannot replicate an entity from another universe which survived conditions beyond our wildest imagination. Others that it is insanity in the sense that we could potentially bring about the end of our galaxy. A few, that we simply cannot create biological beings of such a scale and complexity. That last part is, unfortunately, as of yet true. Which is why we show the first two of little faith they're flat out wrong and start small."
