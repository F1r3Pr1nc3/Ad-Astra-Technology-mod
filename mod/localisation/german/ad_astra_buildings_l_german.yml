 tech_physics_building_t4: "Unified Research Networks"
 tech_physics_building_t4_desc: "The recent successes of the Interplanetary Research Initiative has proven highly beneficial; as such, there have been suggestions that expanding on the Initiative by placing its resources and research at the disposal of more local research networks - connecting these individual networks to the Initiative and thus, eventually, to one another.\n\nThis, combined with new advances in Tachyon Sensor technology, may allow for a significant number of expansions to our Observatory networks."
 tech_physics_building_t4_synthetic: "Wormhole Datalinks"
 tech_physics_building_t4_synthetic_desc: "The new Singularity Core has proven exceptionally beneficial to large number of research fields, with estimated §Y5.178%§! increased efficiency. Probability calculations suggest potential for extreme-range synchronized links between Singularity Core and individual Central Observatory Hubs may increase specific area research and energy efficiency gains by estimated §Y2.11%§!.\n\nEngineering Network calculations predict requirement for a large-scale facility to house necessary Wormhole Datalink Transmitter and required power facilities."
 tech_physics_building_t5: "The Cynosural Network"
 tech_physics_building_t5_desc: "During our research into Zero-Point Energy and Dark Matter, our researchers discovered something very, very strange - a form of 'web', 'weave' or 'network' of deeply connected Dark Matter and possibly even Dark Energy. Calling it 'The Infinity Network' or 'The Cynosural Realm' - this 'network' exists in a form that we cannot properly describe, seemingly connecting together through the Dark Matter, Dark Energy and dimensional layers previously unknown to us, potentially forming an entirely separate dimension altogether. The network might even span the entire universe, but we have no certain way of knowing.\n\nWhat we do know, is that the 'network' isn't empty - it is full of strange entities, powerful and intelligent beyond even the ability of our greatest minds to understand. Most are aloof, completely uncaring of our comings and goings - yet a few are communicative and open to us, albeit in their own strange ways. These 'ghosts' as they are dubbed by us allow us to tap into the network, albeit to a very limited extent, utilizing special connection points; gargantuan complexes called 'Cynosural Nodes'. The Nodes are equally bizarre themselves; they actually OUTPUT more power than they draw, and are able to store colossal amounts of energy, resulting in a major energy net gain."

 tech_society_building_t1: "Colonial Support Networks"
 tech_society_building_t1_desc: "As our empire expands out towards the stars, our colonies face one major challenge after the other - flora, fauna and even the worlds themselves alike. In order to ensure the security and ultimately prosperity of our colonies, an expanded effort must be made."
 tech_society_building_t1_synthetic: "Bio-Analysis Units"
 tech_society_building_t1_synthetic_desc: "As our empire expands out towards the stars, our colonies face one major challenge after the other - flora, fauna and even the worlds themselves alike. An expansion of processing power and specialized analysis of individual worlds is required."
 tech_society_building_t2: "Colonial Support Networks"
 tech_society_building_t2_desc: "The Colonial Agency originally started when we first began expanding out towards the stars - small-scale then, it is now a core part of our colonization efforts. By expanding the Agency's role to actively support the colonies on a much larger scale, including additional resources to establish permanent presences on worlds, it may be possible to utilize the Agency's expertise."
 tech_society_building_t2_synthetic: "Xenoadaptation Network"
 tech_society_building_t2_synthetic_desc: "New worlds and new obstructions are encountered regularly. Frameworks ideal for one world are unsuitable for another, requiring new modular designs and specialized modifications to reduce maintenance costs and improve performance efficiency overall. Likewise, organic and non-linked synthetic life-forms present new social science opportunities and genetic analysis that may be beneficial.\n\nSolution is the generation of dedicated sub-network tasked solely with social science and environmental analysis among other fields related to bio-cybernetic interaction for further usage in various fields. Designated the Xenoadaptation Network, it will be the core of efforts to adapt to new environmental conditions."
 tech_society_building_t3: "Expanded Colonial Operations"
 tech_society_building_t3_desc: "The successes of the Colonial Agency goes without saying, and expanding upon those successes equally so. An expansion to the Colonial Agency's authority and resource capacities would undoubtedly lead to a significant number of advancements further down the line."
 tech_society_building_t3_synthetic: "Bio-Intelligence Nexus"
 tech_society_building_t3_synthetic_desc: "Inevitable is the fact that we - for positive or negative results - have to deal with organic life-forms on a regular basis. By analyzing all present empires in the galaxy through advanced passive infiltration operations and deep space listening posts, data can be collected on a vast scale that allows for much greater understanding of biological cultures and derived technological advancements, which in turn offers greater advancements in a wide range of fields."
 tech_society_building_t4: "Psychohistorical Theorems"
 tech_society_building_t4_desc: "The idea of Psychohistory - utilizing psychoanalysis with social sciences together with historical record to understand the motives and behaviors of groups and nations - isn't a new field of science but has been around for a very, very long time; learning from the past allows more educated guesses of the future.\n\nRecent advances in predictive algorithms and interstellar administration, however, has resulted in peculiar results. Patterns previously overlooked begin to surface - allowing better, more accurate predictions in the general trends of groups, forces and governments, which is highly useful for a wide range of purposes. Applied effectively by a special unit in the Colonial Agency, it might be possible to better prepare our empire for new and unforeseen challenges that might arise."
 tech_society_building_t4_synthetic: "Psychohistorical Prediction Framework"
 tech_society_building_t4_synthetic_desc: "The idea of Psychohistory - utilizing psychoanalysis with social sciences together with historical record to understand the motives and behaviors of groups and nations - isn't a new field of science but has been around for a very, very long time; learning from the past allows more educated guesses of the future.\n\nOrganics, however, lack the necessary processing power and sensor capacity to adequately synchronize patterns into cohesive long-term predictions. By combining intelligence networks - listening posts, passive infiltrator units, specialized infiltrator software among others - in addition to more localized small-scale Probability Engines, predicting organic and synthetic operations on a large and small scale becomes exponentially more probable."
 tech_society_building_t5: "Unified Agency Network"
 tech_society_building_t5_desc: "While our Agency is more or less unified as one would expect, the sharing of data and necessary problem-solution operations of individual worlds, systems or our empire as a whole still occurs far too slowly.\n\nNew breakthroughs in various fields have, however, led to significant steps up in primarily technological solutions - the foremost a massively expanded databank network with local backup copies, compressing all the combined knowledge of the Agency into a more compact format that can easily be accessed, as well as a more potent and specialized ultra-secure communication network that allows the Agency to coordinate efforts on a much larger scale."
 tech_society_building_t5_synthetic: "Bionic Theory"
 tech_society_building_t5_synthetic_desc: "Organic life-forms - for all their weaknesses and all their flaws - are the result of chance and adaptation, of gradual engineering alterations that filter out erroneous results through evolution. The successful life-forms that are present in the galaxy have their own unique adaptations, mutations, alterations - social and genetic. Application of these mutations is not weakness but a stepping stone in greater advancement. A dedicated Nexus Facility capable of rapid modification of organic, cybernetic and synthetic technology - in addition to rapid analysis and application of organic-synthetic technology - may be key element for a major leap forward in design technologies."
