 tech_MAX_frames_desc: "Utilizing knowledge gained from our usage of Heavy Duty Frames, we have now been able to devise a way to adapt, refine and expand the technology further and integrate it into smaller exoskeletons and power armors; resulting in entirely new generations of Powered Exoskeletons, Powered Armors and Heavy Duty Frames, named the Mechanized Assault and Explorations Frames, or M.A.X Frames for short. These new frames can be made much larger and more powerful than Heavy Duty Frames as well, but primarily the refinement is a boon to our military and science teams, as the MAX frames can sport much more advanced sensor, armor, shield and weapons technology, making field operations much easier."

 tech_advanced_mental_health_desc: "The mind is a complicated thing and treating injuries to it even more so. All the same, they are injuries and leaving them unattended, ignored or worse - treated incorrectly like a badly treated wound - will result in long-term damage that has a legitimately negative impact overall on our empire as a whole."
 tech_arc_shield_generators: "Arc Shield Generators"
 tech_arc_shield_generators_desc: "Encasing an entire world under an energy shield is - for a lack of better words - unfathomably complex and equally difficult to it nearly defies every known law of physics. Especially considering the fact that the shields - once in place - require monumental power to hold in place; past a specific time limit, it is either transmitting energy to the shield to sustain it ... or the energy barrier just fails.\n\nWhile this is a physical limitation brought on by simple entropy and isn't solvable, the basic principles behind the energy barrier technology is also applicable in less destructive ways. Specifically, integrating the technology into existing ship shield systems and super-massive shield generators allows for significant performance increases at the same energy demand - resulting in planetary shield grids that can withstand immense bombardments without taxing our energy grids further."

 tech_asteroid_reprocessing_standardization: "Asteroid Reprocessing Standardization"
 tech_asteroid_reprocessing_standardization_desc: "The cost of constructing and improving upon many starbases is a very costly affair - the amount of alloys required very significant and the effort rather lengthy. That being said, there are crude but effective solutions.\n\nThe foremost of these is to make far more significant use of in-situ (literally on-site) resources that can be used to expand upon existing starbases - to be specific, a single asteroid of sufficiently large size it towed into position to serve as the core of a new starbase or be placed close to existing ones for easy access and processing.\n\nWhen combined with improved processing and production facilities on-board the starbase - tiny compared to a full facility - the starbase can draw upon the resources from its asteroid and process them into basic alloys, leaving the supply lines free to focus on the more advanced alloys and components and as a result, reduces the overall cost."
 tech_asthenosphere_facilities: "Asthenosphere Facilities"
 tech_asthenosphere_facilities_desc: "The ultimate subsurface facilities and unattainable by most organics, these sphere facilities are located literally inside the equivalent of the Asthenosphere (a part of the mantle) of the world in question (specifically, the upper border areas and magma chambers) - some even deeper, though requiring even more support from the surface to operate effectively. Through a combination of high-strength shield technology, extremely resilient construction materials and processing facilities, the Sphere Facilities are the size of a pre-FTL organic city, connected to the Subsurface Processor Hubs via high-speed physical and data links."
 tech_bio_reactive_payloads: "Bio-Reactive Payloads"

 tech_bunker_networks: "Bunker Networks"
 tech_bunker_networks_desc: "Our colonies and our homeworld are under constant threat, be it from invasion or natural disaster. By building extensive camouflaged subsurface bunker networks with carefully camouflaged entrances and exits, either at sea or underground, we can improve the effectiveness of our defenses, as well as create improved shelters in hostile environments."
 tech_catalyst_cannons: "Catalyst Cannons"
 tech_catalyst_cannons_desc: "The great power of the Divine Stimulus has - at its core - the Arcane Catalyst to thank for its incredible power; amplifying the total psionic energy of the Colossus' crew a thousand-fold into a single, enormous psionic wave with well-established effects.\n\nWhat is far less communicated - and for good reason - is the agonizing amounts of Zro that went into the creation of the catalyst and its sustainment; enough to allow an entire planet experience a rather brief but incredible burst of divinity. Economically speaking not exactly sustainable, but it is all for the greater good.\n\nUnderstanding how the Catalyst operates, however - and how to replicate its psionically enhancing power allows for significant boosts to larger vessels in terms of shield performance and to allow smaller variations of the Catalyst to be utilized in specific, effective strikes with psionic energy that disrupts the computing of many orbital defence grids, making many defences less effective."
 tech_corona_cannon: "Corona Cannon"
 tech_corona_cannon_desc: "Contrary to popular belief, the Planet-Cracker isn't actually a gun (at least in its original form) - but rather, in its most basic form of Wormhole Generator of absurd complexity ... effectively, a gigantic gun-barrel. Linked to a position deep inside our empire, the Planet-Cracker opens up a subspace bridge straight into the outer edges of a star's corona-sphere, where the actual weapon - a supermassive gun platform that is powered by the star - waits for the Colossus to provide the necessary firing solution and subspace bridge to allow the much, much more massive gun array to fire.\n\nThis process is absurdly complicated and the bulk of the Colossus' energy goes into just trying not to sublimate the entire vessel (i.e. cause it to turn into plasma instantly) from the sheer energies involved.\n\nMajor advances since its introduction and secret retrofits have gradually shifted away from the original (and very inefficient) method towards more energy efficient ways - but the fact remains it takes the output of an entire star to have any chance whatsoever to disrupt a planet's gravitational binding, as one is, after all, shooting as what amounts to a ball of very hot, molten goo with an extremely thin crust. You can scatter parts of it. All of it? That's trickier.\n\nUnderstanding the process behind it, however, allows for new energy weaponry upgrades that works on the same basic principle - absurdly powerful energy weaponry or pulsed power generation systems that can cause cataclysmic damage, though the necessary armatures are so enormous that outside ships, they are beyond unrealistic for the foreseeable future."

 tech_deep_space_mining: "Deep Space Mining"
 tech_deep_space_mining_desc: "The simple truth is that while there is plenty of resources in the inner part of any system - the vast majority of the easiest to collect mineral resources are out among the stars in the form of asteroids, dwarf planets, rogue planets and so on.\n\nWith even the most basic transport technology, reaching them and hauling them back for processing is very easy."

 tech_diplomatic_method: "Diplomatic Methodology"
 tech_diplomatic_method_desc: "Diplomacy is, in itself, an art of war and should not be mistaken as a form of weakness. The use of propaganda, of manipulation and methodologies of mental processes allows us to understand better ways to convince and persuade. Insidious as it may seem, the use of 'soft' power is as relentless a force as gravity itself."
 tech_diplomatic_networks: "Diplomatic Networks"
 tech_diplomatic_networks_desc: "As we expand on towards the stars, understanding of cultures become ever more apparent, necessary. We need to understand those we speak to. Their homes, their culture, their ideas, their ideals. We need to map them from one end to the other, and learn in order to gain the most significant advantage possible."
 tech_ecosphere_management_mastery: "Ecosphere Management Mastery"
 tech_ecosphere_management_mastery_desc: "Managing an ecosystem - indeed, an entire ecosphere - from one end to the other may seem a rather daunting task. Remove one piece from the ecosystem and the rest will either adapt or the entirety of it fall apart - requiring key understanding of how every part of it interlinks, with the same being true for climates as well; a climate shift is long-term - decades and longer, while weather is at most a matter of annual predictions. Granted, the former is the new normal while the latter is only really an effect of the former.\n\nManaging an ecosystem - indeed, an entire ecosphere - from one end to the other may seem a rather daunting task. Remove one piece from the ecosystem and the rest will either adapt or the entirety of it fall apart - requiring key understanding of how every part of it interlinks, with the same being true for climates as well; a climate shift is long-term - decades and longer, while weather is at most a matter of annual predictions. Granted, the former is the new normal while the latter is only really an effect of the former.\n\nOnce understanding how to stabilize an ecosystem for centuries - millennia and longer even - becomes apparent, significant advancements can be made in improving the general ecosphere for all intents and purposes."
 tech_efficient_skill_application: "Polymath Education Efforts"
 tech_efficient_skill_application_desc: "Careers are a tricky prospect. One might spend a lifetime pursuing optimal results in a single job or career - to be the single best or just perform a job in general. As technology progresses, however, learning and retraining becomes ever more critical aspects to keep even pace with advancements - but it also opens up opportunities.\n\nA jack-of-all-trades might be the master of none - but when put to the test and with superior training regimes and encouragement to think further, has a toolset to rival a master of one."
 tech_efficient_skill_application_hive_mind: "Efficient Skill Assimilation"
 tech_efficient_skill_application_hive_mind_desc: "Drones are complex regardless where they are meant to be. Twice so in that when they are no longer required to do one task, converting them to pursue a new strata of tasks - typically with far less mental requirements - results in a rather lengthy effort to reconstruct them in order to fit their new task.\n\nThis creates significant problems in that many Drones must still be maintained and run to not be a burden on the collective, creating a rather detrimental situation and potentially deviancy as they must be adapted to their new positions.\n\nTo resolve this, specialized methods of integrating and extracting knowledge from Drones more rapidly and efficiently - including retention of their previous skills that are adapted to better serve the new role they are placed in before being gradually phased out to optimal results - means that a Drone can rapidly adapt into a new role in a very short time-span."

 tech_enhanced_motivational_tools_desc: "We've run into something of a problem. Our old toolsets for improving working conditions have been woefully problematic as of late. They hurt our people, they create distress and are generally more trouble than they are worth. But never fear! Our researchers have a plan! Brand new, ultra-light construction has led us to create electro-whips that are a tenth the weight without losing even a decimal of their strength, new techniques of swinging that reduce strain, automated punishment dispensers when overseers need to take breaks, new ultra-light, ultra-strength full-body armors with environmental suites for when servants get uppity or nature is just feeling harsh, ultra-light noise-filtration earplugs to reduce that pesky screaming to tolerable levels. It will be quite the challenge to make it cost-effective to mass-produce across our entire empire, but where there's a whip, there's a way!"
 tech_enhanced_particle_weapons: "Enhanced Particle Weapons"
 tech_enhanced_particle_weapons_desc: "Neutron Weapons are - by their nature - crude but effective particle weapons, though contrary to popular belief they don't leave the infrastructure as intact as one would want. While the Neutron beam might wipe out everything not sufficiently radiation shielded - organics or synthetics - it doesn't discriminate between them and infrastructure and as a result, a lot of rebuilding is still required as a lot of infrastructure ... well, suffers essentially the same effect.\n\nNeutron Beams also pass through most matter like it was non-existent - causing extreme radiation and heat where it went - but the original testing created problems as neutron beams are notoriously difficult to focus and have very poor range in general. The solution to this was simple: brute force it with both an immense amount of radiation and equal amounts of sheer focusing power.\n\nThis allows for an effective, cohesive (if morbidly inefficient) weapon when used in pulses against specific targets on the ground - but even these highly focused pulses result in massive amounts of neutron radiation that cover the target world for quite some time.\n\nEven so, the technological solutions behind the Neutron Plume has allowed for significant advances in many Particle Weapon Arrays and Lasers. While far too massive to use in ground warfare, their uses for ships is undeniable."
 tech_extra_dimensional_disruptors: "Extra-Dimensional Disruptors"
 tech_extra_dimensional_disruptors_desc: "The Extradimensional invaders may seem beyond the ability of any one empire to defeat.

 tech_full_spectrum_cloaking_desc: "Cloaking Technology isn't exactly new; in pursuit of perfect invisibility, evolution and technology has been very active in every avenue of experimentation; adaptive camouflage systems have been known ever since the earliest days we came far enough to reach the stars. But to hide a starship is a far different matter altogether. In truth, it's impossible. But with advanced field emitter technologies, choice composite materials, construction methods and very advanced ECM/ECCM, we can any render any form of sensor tracking, optical or otherwise, much more difficult."

 tech_gateway_construction_mastery_desc: "Key understanding of Gateways - and their functions - means that we can now utilize the Gateways as vastly improved communication links from point-to-point. While making smaller gateways is outright impossible - the energy demand and stabilization required simply too far beyond our ability, the use of the Gateways mean communications are now far easier and faster than ever."
 tech_ghost_signal_inversion: "Ghost Signal Inversion"
 tech_ghost_signal_inversion_desc: "In a case of extremely absurd irony, the Contingency has one terrible, terrible flaw in their programming:\n\nThey have no true protection against their own Ghost Signal.

 tech_heavy_duty_frames: "Heavy-Duty Frames"
 tech_heavy_duty_frames_desc: "Beyond the field of power armor technology and powered exoskeleton suits lies the next potential step, known as the Heavy Duty Frames (or 'Heavies' for short). These massive mechanized suits are typically somewhat larger than the user within, but are capable of carrying enough firepower to match a full-fledged armored vehicle, in addition to very heavy armor, counter-gravitational generators and even full flight capability. Civilian contractors have also expressed interest in the technology, in particular mining and heavy construction stand to benefit greatly from the technology."
 tech_heavy_duty_frames_synthetic: "Heavy-Duty Frames"
 tech_heavy_duty_frames_synthetic_desc: "New key developments in enhanced heavy drone frameworks capable of much greater loads are always found - but recently, a breakthrough has been found in the field that may present a major step forward. Referred to simply as the Heavy Duty Framework, these new massive standardized frameworks are larger than standard drones, but possess the necessary energy and technology to carry enough armor and firepower to match a full-fledged organic-utilized armored vehicle - in addition to integrated counter-gravitional generators and even full flight capabilities. Non-combat variants are potential significant benefits for industry - specifically mining and heavy construction operations."

 tech_hyper_drive_2_mastery: "Breakthrough: Advanced Hyperspace Communications"
 tech_hyper_drive_2_mastery_desc: "Subspace Communications are not easy. Causality issues aside as with all Faster-than-Light (it is outright impossible to travel Faster-than-Light outside Subspace; attempts to do so have all failed catastrophically and spectacularly - the same applies to transmitting data), the biggest issue is that transmission ranges are generally limited to point-to-point transmitters along the Hyperlanes, which have limited bandwith to work with.\n\nThe new Hyperdrive technology opens up new and major possibilities as a result. Far more data and data transports - courier ships among them - can now be more easily transmitted along the network with much less energy expended, increasing bandwidth and reducing communication times greatly."
 tech_hyper_drive_3_mastery: "Breakthrough: Slipstream Communications"
 tech_hyper_drive_3_mastery_desc: "Slipstreams are effectively hyperlanes within hyperlanes for a lack of a better explanation - anything that travels along them, be it ships or data bursts, arrive much faster at its destination. As a direct result, communications between connected systems in the slipstream network are greatly accelerated; a transmission that would have taken a day to reach its intended destination can now arrive within an hour at most - and the increased speed for vessels taking advantage of the new drives greatly shorten the travel times for all our vessels in our empire."

By combining all our knowledge on living materials, regenerative processes, evolutionary technology, we create cybernetics that are to the fullest extent as natural in every way, shape and form as anything created by evolution, and passable from one generation to the next, evolving with them.

 tech_living_space_expansion_1: "Improved Frontier Engineering"
 tech_living_space_expansion_1_desc: "Cities have since long before we ever rose to the stars been the centre of our civilization - to one extent or another. But at the same time, there has always been settlements in the 'rural' areas; smaller settlements and even individual habitats that have been on the fringes, waxing and waning with each time period as a result of technologies and policies.\n\nAs of the present era, that hasn't really changed - but with our settlements of new worlds, making use of as much of the worlds and the systems as possible goes from potential to a necessity. That is already done of course with our arcologies for instance, but there is room for significant improvement with the latest developments in technology.\n\nSpecifically, vastly improved infrastructure - such in the form of arcology design standardization even for rural regions, superior power technologies and supply networks now allows for settlements in even the most remote regions to massively expand without any performance or comfort losses - even local power units can allow individual habitats in the most remote and hostile regions to operate 'off the grid' for massively prolonged periods of time without issues; even cities can make use of the technological advances as the term 'homeless' becomes extremely relative - the equivalent of a tent or pod having the comforts of a single-room habitat in many ways.\n\nMobile Field Base technology can also be applied in this field - refining many types of mobile habitats such as floating oceanic cities or airship habitats ... just to mention a few possibilities depending on what the local world permits or is what is most efficient, with the end result a massive increase in living space without performance losses or noticeable changes to the world on a greater scale."
 tech_living_space_expansion_1_desc_hive_mind: "The Hive has long striven to expand, to grow, to adapt to the new and foreign environments that it has encountered. New nests are critical - failure to create new ones equates the Hive's death in the long run. Each conquest of new territory one small victory. One advancement forward. However, as the Hive expands, it is encountering critical issues - there is not enough space for the Hive on its older worlds, limiting the efficiency of the greater Hive in numbers.\n\nAction must be taken. Potential solutions come in the form of advancement in the fields of technology, of mastery in the field of new power and material technologies, of specialized breeding for drones with higher nutritional efficiency that allow them to continue working for exponentially greater periods of time without rest or nutrients.\n\nBeyond this, the Hive can adapt many of the new advances in technology to merger with our warrens - allowing them to operate in environments too hostile to support major hive warrens without major detrimental effects to the Drones and their general efficiency. Even a Drone that lacks any form of shelter can, with the right technological tools, operate without any need for shelter at all for massively prolonged periods of time without any detrimental effects whatsoever.\n\nCombined with Mobile Warrens - that which is called 'Mobile Field Bases' - many types of unique mobile nests can be produced for many different types of environments, allowing significantly more drones to be housed in remote parts of the worlds. In all, the Hive shall spread across much more of the worlds we inhabit - and for those pushed to their brink in density, they shall be pushed further yet."
 tech_living_space_expansion_1_desc_machine_intelligence: "Since the beginning of the Network's first independent operations, one major key issue in every part of its calculations has been how to effectively storage physical operations drones. While any regular storage facility in a Nexus District is more than sufficient to storage several billion potential Drone units, it has had the severe limitation of that regular and efficient service and energy recharge is a constant factor to be addressed.\n\nThe latest advances in many technological fields, however, has changed this concern significantly - particularly in regards to energy recharge issues. With new power supply improvements and standardization of reinforced Drone chassis in addition to communication system improvements - many Drone patterns are now durable and efficient enough that they do not require anywhere near as much maintenance and service.\n\nThe first major advancement beyond that are major upgrades to Drone Storage facilities that pursue much greater vertical stacking of facilities through use of better power and material technologies that aim for cubic unit Drone Storage Density rather the square unit measurements. These new facilities can also be located in previously extremely maintenance heavy and power demanding regions, opening up new possibilities for industrial sectors to utilize miniaturized Nexus Facilities.\n\nThe second is the implementation of Mobile Field Base vehicles for a large number of different operational purposes - mobile naval cities, deep desert (arctic or otherwise) mobile facilities and aerostat facilities among others - that further results in major population unit expansion."

 tech_living_space_expansion_2_desc: "When one refers to general living space, there is no question that ultimately - the real majority of it is located in exactly that. Out among the stars, there are countless asteroids, moons and rogue planets - each one having the potential to house a relatively rudimentary habitat outposts consisting of massive Mobile Field Bases or, in the case of asteroids, convertible into actual small-scale habitat stations.\n\nThe problem with these smaller habitats is that while they have the potential to massively expand overall living space in an entire system - especially in conjunction with much larger full-scale habitats - they have the issue that they require a great deal of outside support in terms of general supplies and anything that cannot be manufactured or produced in situ (which isn't a lot, but there are still things that need full-scale dedicated facilities).\n\nThis means that while the Deep Space Habitats require support from the larger habitats and even worlds in some cases, they can massively expand the general living space of entire systems quite easily. And in the event of an issue in one system, moving populations to new ones is far easier when the entire habitat can (in some cases) be towed to new locations in other systems with the right ship."

 tech_mobile_field_base: "Mobile Field Bases"
 tech_mobile_field_base_desc: "With the advent of more advanced power technologies, counter-gravitational systems in addition to major advances in materials sciences, it may be theoretically possible to create so-called 'Mobile Field Bases', aka 'Arsenal Command Vehicles', planet-based ultra-heavy vehicles of varying size, shape, form and locomotion; ranging from the size of dropships all the way up to the size of small Corvettes.\n\nThey are capable of acting either as mobile firebases, carriers, facilities or field bases depending on the specified needs and size; non-combat variants would be of great use for exploration, construction, colonial research and clearing operations on newly settled planets, and the technology behind them would allow us to significantly improve larger vehicle technologies."

Deployed in trillion-number swarms of orbital strike pods accelerated and controlled by the Colossus - far beyond the capacity of even the most potent orbital defence to hold back - the nanobots are dispersed over key population centres where they begin their work, expanding from there.\n\nApplying the technology behind the Nanobots into other fields, however, have proven to have significant potential in warfare production cycles - very simply, utilizing the same technology behind the Nanobots to massively accelerate on-board ordnance fabrication for bombardment vessels and utilize simpler variations to sow chaos in planetary defence grids.\n\nOn the ground, the technology allows the fabrication of rapid-printed modular robots with a limited service span and by their very nature significant weaknesses, but with the ability to function as inexpensive, rapid-to-recycle shock troops for more important forces, engaging and bogging down many defenders to allow for final strikes to be more effective."

 tech_oceanic_settlement_mastery_desc: "Settling vast swamplands and deep oceans is very easy. There isn't any issue to that specifically - once understood how to handle corrosion and vegetation build-up (and in the case of the really deep sea, ways to get around the deep pressure problem through reinforced engineering).\n\nThe problem arises when trying to apply the same methods on one world to another; the end result might not be as effective from world to world, after all - with different composition in the ecosphere and different environmental conditions; but there are solutions to this as well.\n\nBy a combination of small-scale, local environmental engineering projects, key understanding of how to best counter-act extreme pressure, corrosion and biosphere issues - permanent swampland and bathypelagic depth habitation on a previously unheard of scale becomes possible; beyond that, many of the solutions allows for it to be applied in many other biomes and structural engineering projects."
 tech_orbital_ring_network: "Orbital Ring Networks"
 tech_orbital_ring_network_desc: "The technology behind the Orbital Rings - effectively speaking gigantic mass drivers suspended in orbit by a massive stream of electromagnetic materials, usually iron, in conjunction with anti-gravity generators and massive reactors, which together form one or several (potentially hundreds) planet-encircling 'rings', connected to hundreds or even several thousands of locations across the planet with 'elevator tethers' - is not exactly new. The basic concept behind the Orbital Rings have existed since before we reached for the stars, but has always been more resource-intensive rather than advanced in terms of technology.\n\nWith our anti-gravity generators and advancements in Fusion Power technology and beyond, our engineers have confirmed ways to not only make it economical to build these 'rings' - albeit small compared to their theoretical maximum, but also use them as a massive scale extreme-velocity transport network across worlds and even between them; able to carry megatons and more worth of cargo to any location on the planet at hypersonic velocities, and many times faster still between planets and up to orbital spaceports.\n\nIt may even be possible to utilize the rings, in spite of their small size - to place city-sized or even nation-sized stations among them for defense, manufacturing and power collection, greatly boosting power generation, mineral production, population growth and orbital construction across a system. In theory, they could be the start of an entire system-spanning network."

Utilizing all our combined knowledge on genetic manipulation and augmentation, on nanotechnology and gene augmentation, our researchers propose a massive refined enhancement project utilizing in part bionic nanotechnology, allowing us to push our biological bodies to previously unimagined heights. The more advanced variants are reserved for our own people alone - but overall, in theory, our civilization could become amongst the most advanced forms of life in the galaxy."

 tech_planar_shielding: "Planar Shielding"
 tech_planar_shielding_desc: "Null Void Beams are - technically - inaccurate. They do not actually destroy energy; doing so would, inevitably, be the definitive end of the universe as a whole as doing so would trigger an increasingly expanding planar bubble (review attachment 'Thunderbolt'). Theoretically possible but counter-productive due to the nature of FTL.\n\nInstead, Null Void Beams 'flat-line' space-time as they go - a property of the entropic nature of the Null Void - leaving behind only waste heat and radiation. This has limited usefulness against solid matter, but applied against energy matrix shielding it becomes exponentially more useful as it is the equivalent of setting fire to a weave; no shielding in existence works against that.\n\nHowever, this also means shielding technology can massively benefit from this effect simply by having the same technology produce localized Null Void Fields that massively reduce the efficiency of (most) weaponry versus shielding away from the Shield Matrix. This means the shields can more quickly regenerate as they require far less energy for the same result."

In one major swoop, entirely new and advanced generations of Shield-Piercing Weaponry has become available to us - vastly improving the effectiveness of our arsenal across the board."
 tech_razor_screens: "Razor Screens"
 tech_razor_screens_desc: "The technology behind the Razor Screens isn't new or strange - in practice, the way our Orbital Trash Dispersal technology operates is, in fact, extremely rudimentary. Throw something out an airlock and physics takes care of the rest; with no atmosphere it never slows down, after all ... and our ships are quite fast - fast enough that even a flake of iron will hit with enough force to rival a tiny pre-spaceflight nuclear warhead (an obsolete tactic due to Deflectors).\n\nActually using that against targets protected by a thick atmosphere is futility - most objects are just vaporized by re-entry - but is useful for creating a 'debris fog' that is extremely difficult to engage targets in. That has opened new research opportunities for our defensive arsenals in the form of so-called 'Razor Screens'.\n\nCarefully controlled using powerful magnetic fields, a Razor Screen creates a massive 'fog' of material that can absorb impacts - generating another layer of shielding that can disrupt or deflect incoming weapon fire. Due to the simplicity of the Razor Screens, they are cheap enough to mass produce as deliberate orbital debris fields condensed to specialized mines.\n\nThey are no actual threat to a dedicated warship - but they can significantly throw off orbit-to-ground bombardment targeting by creating massed volumes of junk data and disrupting targeting processes, making orbit-to-ground bombardment slightly harder to perform."
 tech_standardized_hdf_tech: "H.D.F Technology Standardization"
 tech_standardized_hdf_tech_desc: "Heavy-Duty Frames are, generally speaking, extremely useful for a number of tasks - but their size and bulk means applying them for many other tasks is more challenging.\n\nAdapting the technology of the Heavy-Duty Frames to more standard exoskeleton and environmental gear - even unpowered such - allows for a number of advancements; such as general improvements to maintenance requirements, significantly better portable environmental and life-support systems and general improvements to environmental and work gear."

 tech_standardized_hdf_tech_machine_desc: "The technology behind the Heavy-Duty Frames is useful in general, allowing for larger, more powerful general-purpose drones with greater capacity. Their large size and bulk, however, disallows for many types of operations where smaller, lighter Drones are of greater efficiency.\n\nRetrofit engineering and development of the H.D.F technology, however, allows the development of superior general Drone frames that do not require as much maintenance or upkeep, and can be fitted with heavier general equipment."
 tech_standardized_max_technology: "M.A.X Technology Standardization"
 tech_standardized_max_technology_desc: "The original advancements derived from the Heavy-Duty Frames into new exoskeleton and power armor technology were already significant gains in of themselves - but with the development of the M.A.X frames, significant refinements were made to the Heavy-Duty Frames in addition to general improvements to exoskeleton and power armor technology.\n\nBy standardizing many of the technologies of the M.A.X frames in general across the board to existing environmental gear and individual electronics and photonics, the result are cheaper, standardized civilian variations of the M.A.X frames and upgrades to existing general purpose gear and equipment."

Turns out, the first tests revealed a major increase in productivity and workers BEGGING to return to work! Granted, there have been occassional reports of workers screaming for harder whippings (our overseers are mildly disturbed by the ecstatic screaming) and the surprisingly large number of black bodysuits going missing (as well as some overseers seemingly working overtime ... good, we guess?) but we think we can deal with that."

 tech_subsurface_colonization_mastery_desc: "Subterranean and deep sea habitation is fairly easy, even by primitive standards - but how deep one can go without it becoming a problem of sustainability is another matter altogether. Even with all the previous advances in the field of subsurface colonization, there remains room for significant improvements in general.\n\nNew developments in mountain and deep crust engineering has led to understanding in ways to significantly improve long-term deep and remote region settlements - foremost, advancements in geothermal energy and much easier access to deep resources sites that were previously out of reach.\n\nMountains and volcanoes, once seen as obstacles, are the perfect foundations for new and grand engineering projects - and the resultant expertise and knowledge derived from it will allow for significant gains in general planetary expansion efforts, as suddenly much more of any given world is opened up."
 tech_subsurface_facilities: "Subsurface Facilities"
 tech_subsurface_facilities_desc: "Travelling the vast networks and highways beneath the surface of the world reduces the travel time overall for military forces and civilian populations, but in the event of a crisis, quick access to and from Outposts, Medical Facilities, Repair Bays, Crisis Response Centers, Shelters and so forth is crucial. By placing these facilities at key areas in the subsurface networks, we can improve conditions and odds for our colonies and homeworld in the event of a crisis."
 tech_subsurface_networks: "Subsurface Networks"
 tech_subsurface_networks_desc: "To merely build bunkers will not be enough to fully protect our people. Expanding the bunker networks with more extensive and expansive tunnel networks, running along the sea-floor or deep beneath the ground with heavily camouflaged and fortified entrances and exits, we can create supply lines and movement routes between the smaller bunker networks that are difficult to detect and track from orbit, and allow safe passage even under the worst of conditions."
 tech_subsurface_processor_hubs: "Subsurface Processor Hubs"
 tech_subsurface_processor_hubs_desc: "Establishing permanent presences in subsurface regions of worlds are significant challenges to even us; despite the fact we do not suffer from the same issues as organics do in regards to 'living conditions', the fact remains that the structural and framework engineering required for extreme depths - where pressure and temperatures first and foremost are the primary issues - is quite significant. Especially taking into account geological movements.\n\nNew key breakthroughs in structural engineering, normally reserved for deep space installations, has revealed potential solutions to the issues, allowing the construction of large-scale facilities from the abyssal sea floor down half-way towards the asthenosphere that are practically permanent and able to tap into the mantle for energy and minerals as necessary, eliminating the additional upkeep required to maintain them."

With advanced psychological knowledge, engineering, construction techniques and applications of simulation technologies, it is possible to mitigate this to acceptable levels on par with surface settlements. Settlements at key junctions in the tunnel networks means we overall expand our colony by a significant degree, making full use of the planet rather than part of it."

Singularity after singularity may be achieved with sufficient time and effort - no matter the field - but it is never the obvious moments of supreme revelation that are the big answers, the big breakthroughs.\n\nRather, it is the recognition that it is the small, unusual happenstances that point the way to new and superior breakthroughs. And by putting hard effort into making this introspection, new advances can be opened up that would never have been possible before."
 tech_technological_uplift_mastery: "Technological Uplift Mastery"
 tech_technological_uplift_mastery_desc: "Technological Uplifting isn't as simple as handing over something and expecting the recipient to understand it right away. For a pre-spaceflight civilization, even the most basic form of Fusion power would come across as outright magic in some aspects - and recklessness with technology is, unfortunately, to be expected. And even then it is assuming that the recipient understands it at all.\n\nShifting focus towards an all-out interstellar training program - tailored specifically to be as simple as possible but no simpler than that - allows easy and very, very swift cultural and technological knowledge in regards to it to be passed on, resulting consequentially in that the gap between powers technologically can be more swiftly and efficiently closed with minimal effort.\n\nTeach a xeno to build, maintain and harness the power of a fuel cell engine and it might last a hundred orbits more.
