 tech_administrative_ai_mastery: "Breakthrough: Administrative Systems"
 tech_administrative_ai_mastery_desc: "The sheer volume of administrative operations that have be conducted on a day-to-day basis is often staggering. Billions of requests, processes, analytical files, responses and so onward and onwards have to be handled on a day-to-day basis for each individual planet; and this is merely the superficial layers of it all. Handling §Yall§! of it requires an administrative force to outstrip armies, but can be streamlined and made far more efficient and effective with the aid of Administrative AI support."

 tech_automated_exploration_mastery: "Breakthrough: Assistant Explorer AI"
 tech_automated_exploration_mastery_desc: "Exploration is hazardous - it isn't belief, it's fact. Space is dangerous beyond all comprehensible measure, and will not forgive even a slight lapse in judgement or error overall. The Exploration Protocol AIs have helped greatly to allow our science fleets to traverse beyond into new, uncharted space - but they can also help by databank uplinks to the vessel in addition to an entirely new generation of exploration and analysis gear, which can help the crew identify hazards and act accordingly."
 tech_cryostasis_1_mastery: "Breakthrough: AI Ship Support Systems"
 tech_cryostasis_1_mastery_desc: "Utilizing the same technology as with our colony ships - essentially giving partial control to an Artificial Intelligence or Augmented Intelligence to assist our vessels, we can rotate the majority of the crew in a suspended animation with only a skeleton crew active, greatly reducing the amount of required materiel and supplies during long voyages, and waking them up again when a full crew is required."
 tech_cryostasis_2_mastery: "Breakthrough: Ship Support Optimization"
 tech_cryostasis_2_mastery_desc: "By utilizing enhanced Artificial Intelligence or Augmented Intelligence systems capable of self-optimization, keenly aware of the purpose for which they were made and tailored accordingly, the onboard usage of resources can be dramatically reduced as the AI systems can optimize the usage of resources onboard to maximum efficiency without it becoming detrimental to the crew."
 tech_experimental_subspace_navigation_mastery: "Breakthrough: Subspace Beacons"
 tech_experimental_subspace_navigation_mastery_desc: "Hyperlanes are the foremost way of travel throughout the galaxy. They form colossal 'strings' through subspace - the closest way to describe them in a simple fashion is alike currents in a sea or jet-streams in an atmosphere. They are not the only way to travel - just the fastest.\n\nNavigating through Subspace itself on smaller Hyperlanes - or, in more extreme cases - through Subspace itself without a Hyperlane, is extremely dangerous. There's no telling when or where one will emerge after entering Subspace in such instances. By setting up a series of Subspace Beacons and tuning our vessels to them, however, this process can be made far easier and safer as the Beacons serve as navigation points."
 tech_extradimensional_weapon_1_mastery: "Breakthrough: Extra-Dimensional Technology"
 tech_extradimensional_weapon_1_mastery_desc: "The technology behind the so-called 'Extra-Dimensional' weapons we are now capable of producing is ... bizarre, and astoundingly complex - yet undeniably effective. It should be noted that the rumors that these weapons produce 'Hell Rifts' is utter and complete nonsense."
 tech_gravitic_sensor_fusion_standardization: "Breakthrough: Gravitic Sensor Fusion Standardization"
 tech_gravitic_sensor_fusion_standardization_desc: "In exploration operations, the risks are enormous even on the seemingly 'mundane' operations; in part, boiling down to the inherent risk for the explorers lacking the necessary information they need to make effective decisions.\n\nThe standardization of Gravitic Sensor Fusion arrays - essentially speaking, making use of Gravitic Sensors on such a small scale that individual explorers can be outfitted with massively upgraded sensor suites - reduces many of the inherent risks in conjunction with the ability to actually read the data effectively.\n\nA gravitational anomaly might indicate anything from a hidden trap to a hidden cache - but knowing it's there from an extreme distance and being able to determine what it is from that same distance can make gigantic differences. It can also be utilized to fine-tune many of our older sensor technologies to an incredible degree, making significant differences for a lot of our research stations."
 tech_interlinked_interceptor_grids: "Breakthrough: Interlinked Interceptor Grids"
 tech_interlinked_interceptor_grids_desc: "The first core rule of all combat is simple - don't get hit in the first place. Problem is, combat tends to involve getting hit. A lot. And even after the advent of the first Deflector screens, the fact remained that nothing could quite replace a solid barrier of Point-Defense Weaponry, if only because it meant holding missiles at bay.\n\nThis generally holds true for practically every level of our military forces - but different threats tend to require different solutions, both in terms of 'soft-kill' counter-measures throwing off targeting solutions and 'hard-kill' solutions that involve flat out vaporizing, disintegrating or otherwise obliterating the incoming threat.\n\nThis has led our research and development to analyse our advances in Interlinked Support Systems - recognizing that together with advances in Flak Weaponry and enhancements to our Autocannon Systems, significant improvements can be made to our Close-In Weapons Systems overall with vastly improved tracking and fire control systems overall - but by interlinking each CIWS system together as one, sharing data, the end result is a near-literal 'wall' of deadly accurate ordnance.\n\nThat is only part of it, however. The same upgrades means a lot of kinetic weaponry can be massively improved upon in performance with superior targeting, improvements to payload munitions and more rapid rate of fire weaponry - in addition to improved 'Soft-Kill' Targeting Disruptor Arrays and Active Protection Systems with very short range but the ability to destroy incoming ordnance, improving overall performance of many armor technologies, as these arrays can be made significantly smaller than full-on PD Arrays.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"
 tech_ionized_plasma_conduits: "Breakthrough: Ionized Plasma Conduits"
 tech_ionized_plasma_conduits_desc: "The latest generation of Multi-Spectrum Lasers now incorporate X-Ray technology - while in itself extremely useful for improving the overall performance of our existing Laser Technology, the technology has additional uses that makes is very useful for significantly improved Disruptor and Plasma Weaponry, specifically in the form of highly ionized plasma controlled by a more potent variation of our first generation Laser-Induced Plasma Channels and key lessons learned from studying various lightning phenomena, including Ball Lightning.\n\nThe short of it is what amounts of Ion Guns (not to be confused with the basic tool used in research) or in the larger cases, so-called Ion Cannons; Lightning Weapons crudely speaking in regards to their effect - which fire significantly ionized plasma either in a magnetically bottled 'bolt' that behaves like a projectile or as a beam which acts more alike primitive Electrolasers ... with both pros and cons to both variations, though they are very effective against EM-sensitive systems and as less-than-lethal weapons against organics.\n\nWhile this in turn allows us to fine-tune our Laser technologies to even greater efficiency, the real gain lies in being able to utilize the effect to reduce waste heat and radiation bleed - allowing the weapon to maintain its full power and focus for significantly greater distances, making it far more effective.\n\nIt should be noted that while this means we can now scale Plasma and Disruptor Weapons down to the size of small arms with relatively minor issues of waste heat and radiation (still requires protection), the range and required containment fields means these are generally short-ranged weapons outside large vehicles and installations, with the bulk of the power going into keeping the beam or bolt on target and not losing its energy.\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"
 tech_lasers_2_mastery: "Breakthrough: Blue Laser Arrays"
 tech_lasers_2_mastery_desc: "Laser technology has been around since before we took to the stars - in one shape or another. However, applying the technology thus far to anything aside starships and some limited point-defense has proven difficult due to several reasons. Power and size of the capacitors are the two most obvious, but lasers also have the issue that at weapon-grade power, even stray reflections or even just hitting smoke can easily blind the vast majority of unprotected organics and wreaks havoc with high-sensitivity sensor equipment due to scattering.\n\nThe new generations of 'Blue' Lasers solves many of these issues, leaving us with the remaining issue of size, power and range - but even so, we can now adapt these new Lasers as Planetary Defense Weapons and even vehicles and aerospace craft weaponry."
 tech_micro_fusion_cells: "Breakthrough: Micro-Fusion Cells"
 tech_micro_fusion_cells_desc: "It was thought for the longest time that harnessing the power of Anti-Matter - by far one of the most volatile substances in the universe, as any contract with anything other than other anti-matter causes instant annihilation with an explosive force to dwarf even fusion weapons - was utterly impossible. In part because most of the energy was lost as Neutrinos - at the time considered unusable overall, and in part because handling the reaction was extremely difficult.\n\nWhile it is impossible to have ground-based Matter/Anti-Matter Power Plants on the ground, being simply so volatile that a small accident would obliterate entire regions, the knowledge on how to efficiently contain and harness Matter/Anti-Matter's power has resulted in quantum leaps for our Power Cell and Micro-Fusion Technologies - allowing the creation of Micro-Fusion Cells that are as safe as our Fuel Cell technology and able to scale down to the same size."
 tech_mining_drone_weapon_1_mastery: "Breakthrough: Mining Laser Enhancements"
 tech_mining_drone_weapon_1_mastery_desc: "The application of the Mining Drone Lasers in the most obvious way goes without saying - it is, after all, a highly advanced Mining Laser."
 tech_multi_spectrum_laser_conduits: "Breakthrough: Multi-Spectrum Laser Conduits"
 tech_multi_spectrum_laser_conduits_desc: "UV-Lasers are hardly novel technology - they have been around since well before we reached to the stars in many fields of research - but the latest generation of UV-Laser Arrays are in fact vastly improved variations of Free-Electron Lasers that can rapidly tune to various frequencies, with the primary difference simply being that their energy efficiency can now be pushed to even greater heights, resulting in Laser Weapons of greater effectiveness for more equal power drain.\n\nThat said, this also has significant uses for many other fields. Disruptors - essentially short-range Particle Weapons - and Plasma Weapons all make use of this, utilizing a Laser and very powerful magnetic fields to keep the beam or the bolt stable long enough strike a target.\n\nThere are problems with making Plasma and Particle Weapons work in atmosphere, however, which significantly limits their effective uses - they are very low density, usually very hot (resulting in major waste heat and things catching fire very quickly) and disperse extremely quickly regardless what they are fired in (less than even throwing range), resulting in need to contain and control them.\n\nBy combining lessons learned from all three technologies, major improvements and significant strides have been made to resolve this and improve on all three technologies overall in efficiency and power. Lasers with improved target effects from plasma study on one hand - Plasma and Disruptor Weapons using improved magnetics and laser guidance on the other.\n\nUnfortunately, the power demands, waste heat and radiation means that Plasma and Disruptor Weapons remain unavailable for the time being to anything smaller than very large vehicles and above.\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"
 tech_neutron_particle_weapons: "Breakthrough: Neutron Particle Weapons"
 tech_neutron_particle_weapons_desc: "Prior to our rise to the stars and the development of the first FTL drives, Tachyons were practically speaking purely theoretical; even then, they are contrary to the belief of many primitive empires technically not in violation of the laws of physics as they might have been led to believe - just that outside of explaining it mathematically, Tachyons are impossible to define exactly.\n\nThe long and short of them, however, is that Tachyons are extremely weakly interacting particles under normal circumstances - much alike neutrinos - with the bulk passing through even planets without any sort of reaction. Compressed into ultra-dense streams, however, this changes dramatically through sheer probability.\n\nEven if only 99.9% of all Tachyons pass through the target, 0.1% won't - which results in the Tachyon beam more or less encountering a combination of the Exclusion Principle and rapid shift from FTL speeds to light-speed; the consequence of which is that the Tachyon Particles annihilate both themselves and the target material in an explosion equivalent to matter/anti-matter annihilation; essentially, the target turns into a detonating atomic warhead.\n\nWhile the use of Tachyons as weapons outside extremely large arrays - Battleships, Titans and Anti-Orbital Arrays - isn't realistically possible, basic understanding of the phenomena behind them could be utilized to enhance Neutral-Charge (Neutron) Subatomic Particle Beams among others.\n\nThis translates into a myriad of particle weapons being able to fire straight through atmosphere with little to no energy loss and (relatively speaking) little waste heat - though the problem remains that they require significant energy systems and powerful Electromagnetic Lasers to remain on target.\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"
 tech_phased_plasma_weaponry: "Breakthrough: Phased Plasma Weaponry"
 tech_phased_plasma_weaponry_desc: "Gamma Lasers represent the foremost line of Laser we have to date created. Their extremely high frequency and power means that their incredible destructive potential aside - they are also able to penetrate any type of armor with incredible ease. Most of the time, only bunker-grade materials thick as the length of a vehicle will have even a small chance of stopping an Anti-Armor Beam, meaning that once implemented into our existing Multi-Spectrum Laser Systems, it represents the final say in both deep space and atmospheric laser combat.\n\nThe same fundamental technology, however, is a key piece in making many new advances in Phase and Plasma technology work more effectively - Phase Disruptors, for instance, make use of exotic particles and quantum-phenomena to provoke effects that cause catastrophic effects in matter on an atomic level, but outside starship and superheavy facility armatures, it has so far not been possible to scale it down - even with the latest advances, particle weapons are largely relegated to close-quarters combat. Powerful, but close-quarters.\n\nLikewise, the same technology which allows the bolts to be stabilized is extremely useful in Plasma technology - allowing creation of new Plasma Beam and Bolt weapons taking full advantage of both advances in technology to create a new type of 'Phased Plasma Weapon' system.\n\nThese new weapons have much greater range and far less waste heat and waste radiation than their predecessor systems - allowing for some of the most potent baseline anti-armor weapons possible with them being scaled all the way down to infantry level. Protection is still a requirement, however, as a discharge of any plasma or particle weapon can still set things too close to the armature on fire.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"
 tech_planetary_shield_generator_mastery: "Breakthrough: Planetary Shield Networks"
 tech_planetary_shield_generator_mastery_desc: "The creation of more advanced, even planet-spanning shield generator technology has resulted in several key breakthroughs - most of which being how to simplify the technology behind mass-scale 'Shield Dome' generators, which can now be deployed on an economic scale. This effectively negates significant amounts of long-range artillery and even orbital strikes, evening the odds in defensive actions for our forces."
 tech_polarized_armour: "Breakthrough: Polarized Armour"
 tech_polarized_armour_desc: "As key breakthroughs into high-energy deflector technology and force fields became available, several small key technologies have allowed for Deflectors to become more common-place, even in-atmosphere, though the biggest problem with them has always been energy ... or more specifically, sufficiently small and efficient power sources, as maintaining a Deflector Screen in atmosphere is exponentially more energy intensive than in a vacuum due to interference foremost.\n\nThe introduction of standardized Fusion Power and significantly more powerful energy cells has changed this significantly, however, as it is now - albeit in a limited extent - possible to produce Energy Deflector Screens in atmosphere for non-dedicated facilities in the form of so-called 'Polarized Armour'.\n\nVery simply, Polarized Armour forms low-intensity Deflector fields around the hull or structure, shielding it against radiation and low-energy impacts by simply dispersing the energy across a wider area similar to a primitive dilatant armour material - significantly mitigating the effectiveness of most energy strikes as a result.\n\nThis allows Polarized Armour to be implemented into a vast range of different systems - in planetary and orbital structures, they function as low-power Deflector Screens, rendering incoming weaponsfire less effective ... though it still suffers from the same limitations as normal Deflectors in that they are still too large and too energy demanding to be fitted to anything smaller than structures as larger Main Battle Vehicles.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"
 tech_predictive_stormfire_grids: "Breakthrough: Predictive Stormfire Grids"
 tech_predictive_stormfire_grids_desc: "Named after the Stormfire Cannons, Stormfire Grids represent a quantum leap in Close-In Weapons Systems and our kinetic arsenal, making full use of the latest advances in munitions and advanced predictive targeting algorithms.\n\nIn its simplicity, Stormfire Grids are continuations of the older Interceptor Grids - making use of the Stormfire Autocannon technology in new CIWS arrays for both Point-Defense and Flak Artillery that results in a higher overall rate of fire; together, they are able to detect, track and intercept even relativistic munitions using new rotary mass-drivers using advanced plasma-casing technology (plasma capacitors with extraordinary energy density) or flat-out plasma-based propellant.\n\nThis in conjunction with the Grid's ability to quickly determine the optimal response to each individual target - standard rounds being High-Explosive Armor-Piercing projectiles able to detonate into a hail of shrapnel or penetrate the target and then detonate for maximum effect, with the Grid determining based on sensor data which is the optimal effect.\n\nThat of course is just the basics. With the Grid's ability to quickly switch been advanced armor-piercing rounds, Atomic Howitzer (shape-charge atomics) artillery rounds, conventional high-explosive, particle burst and so on, the Grid is able to make short work of a wide range of different targets.\n\nApplying this to many of our existing kinetic weapon technologies and counter-measure grids, the end result is both highly advanced protection and some of the most potent high-accuracy, high-adaptability baseline kinetic weapon systems to date. In short, we have a gun and a bullet for every occasion and it doesn't take up much more space or mass.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"
 tech_proton_particle_weapons: "Breakthrough: Proton Particle Weapons"
 tech_proton_particle_weapons_desc: "Protons - subatomic particles - are at their basest one of the most fundamental building blocks of the universe in regards to baryonic matter. Two up-quarks, one down-quark - nothing special. But what makes them useful is that they are - fundamentally - so common and easy to produce with our current technology that they represent a limitless ammunition supply.\n\nThe problem with Particle Weapons such as these is fundamental, however - even very small electromagnetic fields can cause a powerful particle beam to disperse into a (relatively) harmless cloud of radiation and possibly plasma. To make them effective as weapons, they need so massive and powerful electromagnetic lenses and conduits that outside battleships and Titans, they are not good enough.\n\nThe recent discoveries in the field of Heavily Ionized Plasma, Particle Lance Emitter Units and Arc Emitter arrays, however, have provided key insights in each individual field - that when combined - have yielded breakthrough advances in all.\n\nMany of our Plasma and Disruptor weapons can now receive upgrades that boost their overall range, performance and ammunition capacity - with super-heavy planetary defence installations able to utilize Particle Cannons so powerful firing them in-atmosphere causes mass devastation for many units around as a side-effect simply because so much atmosphere is hit by the beam (and freak thunderstorms quite often, requiring atmospheric stabilizers).\n\nHowever, due to inherent physical limitations, scaling down the weapons to be used even by personnel weapons is as of yet not possible, though further research might remedy this.\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"
 tech_quantum_spectrum_scanners: "Breakthrough: Quantum Spectrum Scanners"
 tech_quantum_spectrum_scanners_desc: "Tachyon Sensors are incredibly effective sensors - more akin to ancient RADAR or LIDAR, they make use of undetectable particles travelling at FTL-speeds, meaning that even at light-second or light-minute distances, a target can be tracked to pin-point positions effortlessly if using a detector that can - paradoxically - detect them. The biggest problem is, again, size and power, meaning that aside large installations and ships, a full-powered Tachyon Sensor isn't possible.\n\nThe technology, however, means we can now detect, track and analyze what was previously undetectable with ease - applying it across the board to our pre-existing Sensor Technologies means even our smallest sensor unit can detect, track and analyze anything at what would have been considered impossible ranges with zero detectable or harmful emissions and very, very small energy requirements."
 tech_reinforced_polarized_armour: "Breakthrough: Reinforced Polarized Armour"
 tech_reinforced_polarized_armour_desc: "The original breakthrough of Polarized Armour proved a significant advancement in the field of low-intensity Deflector Technology - helping significantly to standardize small-scale Deflector Systems. However, the biggest issue the older Deflectors always faced was the fact they were inefficient and ultimately, proved very little in the way of protection compared to full-on Deflector Arrays.\n\nThis has once again changed with the major advancements in Fusion technology - so-called 'Cold' Fusion - which provided our empire with the opportunity of new and extremely powerful energy cells that solved the inherent power issues of small-scale Polarized Armour technology.\n\nThat - coupled with the discovery of the new Shield Generator System - has proved indispensable for a lot of defensive measures. While we can make significant improvements to districts, facilities and indeed individual structures - replacing older Deflector Technologies completely with new Shield Arrays that are far more easily adapted to atmospheric conditions for instance and so efficient they are no significant drain for our Micro-Fusion Grids - it is now possible to utilize the technology to shrink the size of Polarized Armour and indeed, to a degree add Deflector Systems to individual armour frames.\n\nThe sole restriction on such a small scale - having personal Deflector Screens on top of reinforced Polarized Armour Fields - is simply a matter of energy supply and waste heat generated, improving the overall survivability of field units and structures significantly.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"

It simply defines an intelligence created by artificial means - though in this case, it is defined as a Sapient System, either organic or inorganic, with the capacity for consciousness and higher levels of sentience; formed from either ultra-advanced programming or even derived from duplication of organic neural networks (in essence, an 'upload' of an organic mind - though closer to an AI clone thereof) - serving as researchers, administrators or even commanders as they are needed or desired."
