 tech_dark_matter_deflector_mastery: "Breakthrough: Dark Matter Deflector Matrix"
 tech_dark_matter_deflector_mastery_desc: "The Dark Matter Deflectors are incredibly potent shields - and incredibly energy efficient as well. Able to generate protective shielding many times greater than our standard energy shields, these are by far among the best shields we have ever constructed - worlds protected by them are nearly impenetrable, aerospace craft and vehicles so resilient they are closer to small starships, and the smallest possible producible energy shielding so strong only the employment of older generation high-end vehicle weapons is the only realistic option to penetrate them."
 tech_dark_matter_power_core_mastery: "Breakthrough: Dark Matter Energy Matrix"
 tech_dark_matter_power_core_mastery_desc: "The Dark Matter Generators are ... strange to put it mildly - though they are incredibly potent. While it isn't possible - as far as we know, anyway - to fully replicate these incredibly potent power generators on a smaller scale than ships and starbases, the very technology has given incredible insights into new and immensely efficient power systems that vastly outstrip our older power generation technologies - generating enough energy to outstrip even Matter/Anti-Matter Annihilation reactions in power and power efficiency, yet are completely harmless (disregarding the energy release itself), impossibly stable and non-reactive to virtually everything.\n\nIt will take some time to fully adapt what we learn to our existing power cell technology - but the end result are effectively power cells that are able to last for decades, centuries even without requiring refueling while still operating at peak capacity."
 tech_dark_matter_propulsion_mastery: "Breakthrough: Dark Matter Propulsion Matrix"
 tech_dark_matter_propulsion_mastery_desc: "The technological data on Dark Matter thrusters have proven an absolute treasure trove for our researchers. While installing an effective Dark Matter Propulsion system on anything smaller than a starship remains unrealistic due to the sheer energy demand - among other things - it has opened up a plethora of new enhanced thruster systems that operate at impossibly high efficiency and with significantly less propellant and waste heat for the same amount of thrust.\n\nThis is only part of the equation, however - as the same technology also opens up possibilities for new ultra-advanced mass accelerator technologies. While it will take a long time to properly implement the changes, we're already seeing major improvements across the board overall."
 tech_dragon_armor_mastery: "Breakthrough: Dragonforge Engineering"
 tech_dragon_armor_mastery_desc: "Understanding the structure of the Ether Drake's scales - and how to replicate them in bulk for armor and material structures - has resulted in entirely new generations of materials and entirely new fields of molecular engineering and structural engineering. Everything from armor suits, vehicles, aerospace craft and habitats - all the way to starships and megastructures constructed from this material are extremely resilient and capable of self-repair, meaning that they all require very little to no maintenance overall. Combining this knowledge with our pre-existing material technologies, we may have created the single most overall resilient and effective material in the galaxy."
 tech_drakeforged_thermal_recyclers: "Drakeforged Thermal Recyclers"
 tech_drakeforged_thermal_recyclers_desc: "The original Ether Drake - ancient and powerful beyond all known parameters, perhaps even predating the known universe - was an incredible entity of equally incredible power, though it has significantly waned in the many eons since it came into being to only a fraction of what it once was.\n\nWhat makes the Ether Drake intriguing, however, is in its signature strike - a massive, extremely powerful thermal lance - which by all rights should vaporize any material it comes into contact with ... including the Drake itself. Studying how the Drake species avoided this allows for significant advancements in thermal management - better Strike Craft Heat Recyclers, improved Energy Weapon thermal management among many, many other small things.\n\nWhile the applications do have their limit - many of the beneficial aspects just cannot be replicated that easily - they do allow for major steps forward in general for managing and recycling waste heat."
 tech_enigmatic_decoder_mastery: "Breakthrough: Enigmatic Oracle"
 tech_enigmatic_decoder_mastery_desc: "We still do not have the slightest clue as to how the Enigmatic Decoder truly operates. We can replicate it, we can build it, scale it to any size and yet ... we have no idea how it truly works. The results, however, are telling - in standard tests, the results are predictable, average; but the more effort is put into deception, confusion, avoidance or counter-acting the Decoder by the enemy, the more unnervingly accurate the results become."
 tech_enigmatic_encoder_mastery: "Breakthrough: Enigmatic Encryptions"
 tech_enigmatic_encoder_mastery_desc: "We still do not have the slightest clue as to how the Enigmatic Encoder truly operates. We can replicate it, we can build it, scale it to any size and yet ... we have no idea how it truly works. Utilizing its bizarre technology to the fullest, however - in planetary defense and military operations overall - making our actions predictable to enemy forces becomes all but impossible, as even we do not fully understand them. Yet the results speak for themselves."
 tech_superior_recycling_systems: "Superior Recycling Systems"
 tech_superior_recycling_systems_desc: "The Scavenger was a resilient foe - in part because of its incredible ability to rapidly adapt whatever it could scavenge in the field to its advantage, even when seemingly so broken beyond any measure of repair that realistically, it should never have functioned.\n\nThis has led research and development to investigate the Scavenger's internal technology and systems for clues as to how it achieved this - in part, utilizing incredibly simple yet surprisingly efficient recycling systems. Adapting these systems allows for simpler kinetic munitions to be rapidly made available in-situ from whatever viable composites are found - and its non-combat applications is the ability to extend many mineral and alloy supplies further as recycling now becomes far easier."
