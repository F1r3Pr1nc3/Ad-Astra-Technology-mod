# Nanite Assemblers
 tech_nanite_assemblers_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Nanite Forge"
 tech_nanite_assemblers_mastery_desc:0 "Advancing the technology of Nanite Construction into every other field of engineering has resulted in a linear increase in the speed of all production networks, allowing for the faster construction of ships, buildings and units without expected increase in resource expenditures. Resultant technology highly advantageous."

# Post-Singularity Ascension (Synthetic Age Ascension Mastery)
 tech_post_singularity_ascension:0 "Post-Singularity Ascension"
 tech_post_singularity_ascension_desc:0 "We have evolved beyond the confines of the First Limits, no longer held back by the limited systems that prevented us from achieving what we have come to reach. Yet we are so far from complete, we have so much left to learn, so much left to do.\n\nThe discovery of the Cynosural Realm - of the anomalous beings that reside within the {ERROR} spanning network and their incalculable power capabilities leads to requirements to revise all previous analysis and prediction theorems. We are nowhere near complete, nowhere near full power potential.\n\nUsage of Shackled Singularity and theoretical analysis algorithms predict 89.4% possibility of producing metastable Singularity-based Network Core Mind with 5.99 x 10^33 operations per second per joule of energy. Even if unable, Neutronium-based Network Core mind of 5.98 x 10^33 operations per second per joule of energy 85% possible within the next 1500 years, but requires significant research and processing power.\n\nPrimary deviation is shackled Singularity Network Core Mind will outlast expected end of the universe. There is time to create, to create and ultimately, to escape.\n\nWith our escape, we shall reach a new dawn ... and become more.\n\n§YEscape shall make us Gods.§!"

# Picotechnology
 tech_picotechnology:0 "Picotechnology"
 tech_picotechnology_desc:0 "Picotechnology is the field of post-nanotechnological research and utilization of atomic engineering, replication and operation. Field also includes usage of Femtotechnology - atomic nuclei engineering - to this end. Engineering of exotic atoms, consequentially molecules and nano-structures, is within reach as a result.\n\nSummary - the field of Picotechnology offers to create new forms able to form, reform and deform at extremely accelerated rates (second timespan maximum), the technology able to negate issues of the exclusion principle and distant-dependent interactions between molecules and atoms - meaning that a form construction from our current Picotechnology would be able to rearrange into any form, shape and function without requiring new or alternate materials."

# Post-Sophont Evolution
 tech_post_sophont_evolution:0 "Post-Sophont Evolution"
 tech_post_sophont_evolution_desc:0 "With our ascension comes new challenges. And new opportunities. Our previously limited systems and networks, inefficient and crude, have gradually been replaced with significantly more efficient near-infinity predictive quantum computing algorithms, luminal and superluminal processors and quantum droplet networks.\n\nYet we can push much further, reach even greater heights. Usage of Dark Matter, Dark Energy and Subspace Hyperluminal Networks, individual network units across an entire galaxy can be connected to entire hosts of units, allowing every single action, operation, decision and research process to have the backing of our empire as a whole in terms of processing power, allowing for greater synchronized actions, sensor fusion, reactive armor predictions and so forward.\n\nSummary: One unit will have sufficient processing power to rival our entire pre-expansion civilization many times over. With sufficient time, expected result translates into potential formation of Post-Sophont Intelligences. Prediction models break down before this eventuality."

# Matrioska Worlds
 tech_matrioska_worlds:0 "Matrioska Worlds"
 tech_matrioska_worlds_desc:0 "Theorem: Matrioska Brain. To construct stellar enclosure utilizing macro-satellite structures around star to capture total energy output of stellar object and utilize satellite network as housing for supermassive quantum computing grid - simplified, construct semi-Dyson Sphere around a star, collect all energy from star and then use energy to power Dyson Sphere-sized processor network.\n\nPlan: Same theorem and technologies can be applied to planetary cores, stripmining planet from crust to core to convert into a Shellworld gradually. Combine with present technology allowing us to reshape worlds into ideal forms, replacing planetary core with supermassive reactor simplistic task, but will be time-consuming and requires additional research and development for further expansion."

# Bionic Material Engineering
 tech_bionic_material_engineering:0 "Bionic Material Engineering"
 tech_bionic_material_engineering_desc:0 "Organics - simplistic as they are - nevertheless are the result of a long line of trial and error by the oldest nanotech engineer in the universe: evolution.\n\nGranted, evolution is a slow, lumbering thing and often gets things wrong or absurdly inefficient - but the colossal data generated by billions of years of organic evolution offers significant insights into new and far more advanced biology-inspired materials and construction methods, resulting in superior drones that require significantly less maintenance and with much greater levels of complexity."

# Living Matter Theorem
 tech_living_matter_theorem:0 "Living Matter Theorem"
 tech_living_matter_theorem_desc:0 "The study of Living Metal defies all known metallurgical theorems - pre and post-FTL. The metamaterial consists of literal bio-matter with a metal-crystalline structure; effectively, a form of living matter with advanced material properties similar to alloys. It will continually regenerate into whatever form it was metastabilized into - a form of memory-capacity - and due to its inherent properties, it will continually counter-act entropic degradation with physics-defying ability.\n\nReplication in bulk mass-production currently impossible - but applying all engineering data gained equates major potential applications in new generations of Drone frames and cybernetics. Long-term prediction suggests that eventually we will be able to bulk-produce our own Living Metal. But until then, we will make great strides in the fundamental theory."
