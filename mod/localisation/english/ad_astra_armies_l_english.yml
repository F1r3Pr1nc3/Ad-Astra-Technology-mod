Even among the empire's most powerful forces, they are all but peerless - wearing armour moulded after the molecular structure of the Drakes they travel with and wielding the empire's most powerful defensive and offensive technologies.\n\nThe Drakes themselves, their natural weapons and armour aside, are clad in the empire's strongest armour plating and outfitted with its most advanced technology - their bodies bristling with enough point-defence weapons and shield generators to rival corvettes without hindering their movement. Where they roam, the sky and all below belong solely to them."

Their bodies are integrated with advanced Anti-Armor weapons and their melee strikes are powerful enough to break through reinforced blast-doors with little issue, while they themselves are virtually impervious to anything short of heavy anti-armour weapons.\n\nThe Reavers are noted to be equipped with a vast myriad of safeguards – voluntarily, apparently – including micro-atomic self-destructs - among other things - as a means to avoid capture. The entire horde is supervised by a cadre of scientists and commanders on the other side of the world in question or from a safe orbital position."
