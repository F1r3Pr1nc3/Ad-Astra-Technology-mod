Not even why.\n\nIts location - far from any of other facilities (that we know) - veils a mountain of hidden weapons and shield generators that seemingly appear out of nowhere and armor that seems to defy known physics on a fundamental level. But the greatest weapon is what is at the heart of the fortress itself - or rather, what it does.\n\nSmall alterations here, small alterations there - modifications to armor, shields and weapons, changes to tactics, strategies, logistics, designs across the world are quietly made. Threats we never knew were there in the first place are countered with devastating efficiency, weapons and armor and shields become unnervingly resilient.\n\nThe Fortress may very well be a true legacy of the Enigmatic Fortress. If so, the only logical recourse - reasonably speaking - is not to engage it head-on. But rather bombard the planet till it breaks ... and hope the Fortress does not reemerge somewhere else."
