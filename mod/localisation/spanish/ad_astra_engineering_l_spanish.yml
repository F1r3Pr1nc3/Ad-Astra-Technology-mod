 tech_assembly_pattern_mastery_desc: "Construction has always been a bit of a problem, as parts have to be cut, molded and applied in previously inefficient and time-consuming methods. By streamlining the process and creating standardized 'macro-patterns' which allows for any shape and form of structure - even extremely complicated such, we can massively speed up construction times of anything we put our minds to."
 tech_ceramo_metal_kinetics: "Breakthrough: Ceramo-Metal Kinetics"
 tech_ceramo_metal_kinetics_desc: "While the basics of Ceramo-Metallic Matrix Materials has been well-known long before we ever reached the stars - ceramic and metal composites have been around for a long time - but Ceramo-Metallic Matrix composites are different in the sense that they make use of advancements in nano-material technology to greater effect.\n\nFor our mass driver weapons, this has an enormous number of uses. A projectile made from CM-matrix materials, for instance, can make of ultra-high density metals (such as §YOsmium§!) and Ceramics in composites that negate the inherent brittleness of the projectile, making it able to punch through very, very strong armour composites.\n\nIn the mass driver systems themselves, however, the metamaterials make significant difference as the magnetic fields can be pushed to even greater levels and with greater efficiency as the composites used have both a much higher heat tolerance and also a much higher overall strength that counters the forces that attempt to push the mass driver barrel apart.\n\nThis means many kinetic mass drivers can now be made smaller and more efficient overall in every aspect, improving the effectiveness of our military forces.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"

 tech_crystal_armor_1_mastery_desc: "The strange and complex structure of the Crystalline Entities has resulted in major breakthroughs for armor and material engineering across the board. Light-weight yet immensely resilient, the usage of mimicked crystalline-infused plating into our pre-existing composites has resulted in new, superior materials that are much stronger and overall resilient than anything we've previously produced."

 tech_crystal_armor_2_mastery_desc: "Refining the process of basic Crystal-infused Plating even further thanks to the discovery of the more 'advanced' Crystalline Entities, the resultant super-materials have a structural strength that can only be considered incredible by any known standard. The resultant material composites are even lighter and stronger than ever before, meaning that we can now utilize the technology even further."
 tech_cyclone_warheads: "Breakthrough: Cyclone Warheads"
 tech_cyclone_warheads_desc: "The basics behind the Marauder Missiles is fundamentally simple. At their core, they are Quantum Missiles with limited on-board AI Pilots that lack even the smallest possible sentient capability by necessity (at least, in normal cases) - instead utilizing 'savant' systems that are singularly focused on the task of tracking targets and optimizing the effectiveness of the warhead's power by identifying weak-spots in the shields, armor and hulls of the targets.\n\nWhile this on its own makes for highly effective ship-to-ship missiles, the combination of the Marauder's AI system with the advanced miniaturization technology of the Whirlwind Missiles equate missile systems that combine the best of both into new generalized designs, designated Cyclone Warheads - which have far better warhead control and vastly improved flight performance first and foremost - but they can also be scaled down significantly, even for the smallest line of missiles used in our forces.\n\nThe reason for this isn't greater yield, but simply that the warheads make far superior usage of the warhead's power - the AI system's advanced yield control, scanners and computational systems analyse the target for the weakest spot to strike for maximum effect on target.\n\nThe end result is that while a Cyclone Warhead isn't more powerful in yield, its efficiency in regards to damage is exponentially greater, resulting in that a Strike Craft armed with Cyclone Warheads can cause enough damage to rival a strafing run with our first generation Nuclear Missiles in terms of sheer damage to hostile forces, yet at only a fraction the necessary yield.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"

 tech_droid_workers_mastery: "Breakthrough: Droid Command & Cybernetics"
 tech_droid_workers_mastery_desc: "Droids are far more advanced variants of the original robotic workers and troops that have been previously deployed; more energy-efficient and more powerful, the average droid also has a level of self-autonomy that allows them to be used more effectively in large numbers with only the most basic levels of oversight.\n\nApplying the underlying technology of the Droids to a vast range of automated forces means significantly greater improvements overall, as we acn now field mechanized forces and industrial support wherever and whenever we so need them that are equal to our most basic troops and workers, taking major loads off either.\n\nThe same technology behind them also means we can create more advanced augmentations if and when we so require - while basic, the very fact remains it is now easy to create a basic range of cybernetics that are virtually indistinguishable at first glance from organic matter."
 tech_durasteel_composite_standardization: "Breakthrough: Durasteel Composite Standardization"
 tech_durasteel_composite_standardization_desc: "During our work with previous generations of Ceramo-Metallic Composites and Plasteel, several key breakthroughs suddenly led us to the creation of a new hybrid material, which has come to be called 'Durasteel'.\n\nIn its simplicity, Durasteel is a molecularly engineered form of Ceramo-Metallic Composite with the flexibility of Plasteel - its advanced structure meaning that it can utterly resist the most destructive impacts, radiation, chemicals and temperatures and so forth on a level that would have damaged any Ceramo-Metallic alloy or material beyond any ability to repair.\n\nWhen combined with the fact it is much lighter than regular Ceramo-Metal composites and only fractionally more expensive, Durasteel-based composites can completely replace older generation Ceramo-Metal composites in practically every field they were previously employed.\n\nThe end result is that even basic circuitry is resilient enough to be utilized as Ceramo-Metal Armour plating, making hulls and buildings that incredibly resilient to virtually everything.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"

 tech_durasteel_kinetics_desc: "'Durasteel' is the general name for a wide range of materials that were derived from research into Ceramo-Metallic Composites and Plasteel - resulting in the hybrid material that holds the name. In its simplicity, Durasteel is an engineered form of Ceramo-Metallic Composite with the flexibility of Plasteel - meaning it is far easier to repair and maintain in its basic form.\n\nFor our Mass Driver Weapons, it's a major advancement. Durasteel's composition means that it can effectively replace all existing Ceramo-Metallic Matrix composites in addition to Plasteel with one single composite - albeit of different material compositions, allowing Durasteel projectiles and Durasteel Armatures that are both extremely resilient overall.\n\nThis allows new generations of projectiles - dumb, smart (guided) and all around - that are able to handle accelerations that would have made any form of advanced payload or guidance system impossible, while also being so durable that they can punch straight through first-generation nano-composites - and Mass Driver armatures are able to push the acceleration of the projectiles to immense velocities, solely limited by the issue of equal and opposite reaction from the firing.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"
 tech_fusion_shape_charge_warheads: "Breakthrough: Fusion Shape-Charge Warheads"
 tech_fusion_shape_charge_warheads_desc: "Nuclear Warheads - Fission or Fusion - are mass-to-yield the most efficient weapons of mass destruction that can possibly be built. In in all cases, there is a general and quite significant issue; specifically, when the warheads detonate, they scatter the energy of the explosion in all directions, meaning only part of the energy actually harms the target rather than the bulk of it.\n\nWhile omni-directional blasts do have their uses - especially in confined spaces - when used in ship-to-ship engagements it is quite wasteful. The solution to this issue proved to be actually quite simplistic, coming in the form of a long continuation of much older and more simplistic High-Explosive Shape-Charges - only now, utilizing nuclear charges rather than high-explosives.\n\nUp until now, however, making such a system work effectively has been exceptionally difficult - in part because a nuclear detonation is quite difficult to focus for obvious reasons. But when focused, it concentrates the nuke's power into a 'Nuclear Lance' of plasma and molten materials.\n\nThat means a Nuclear Lance can cause cataclysmic damage even over very long distances - an orbital detonation of a Nuclear Lance against a ground target from orbit wouldn't do as much damage as a direct impact, but orbital defense cannot intercept it and the energies involved would still be enough to melt iron-carbon nano-composites even from that distance.\n\nDetonated from a relatively high altitude, however, the end result are spectacular but difficult to quantify - a test using a mock-up of an Early Space Age base complete with bunkers was a failure as much of the on-site sensor equipment within the blast cone was damaged beyond any repair or salvage.\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"
 tech_ion_pulse_propulsion: "Breakthrough: Ion Pulse Propulsion"
 tech_ion_pulse_propulsion_desc: "Ion Technology in atmospheric systems - such as Ionic Wind systems - have been around for a very long time, indeed partially forming the precursor of the present thruster technologies in our vessels. The problem with Ionic Thruster Technology, however, has always been the same - high power requirements but low thrust.\n\nThe same issue also existed in our Ion Thruster systems - though in the vacuum of space, this is far less of an issue than for atmospheric-based systems. The latest advances in thruster technologies, however, has changed this significantly; by understanding the underlying technology and having a deeper understanding of the general physics behind them, Ion Technology can now be applied to pre-existing Chemical Thruster technologies.\n\nThe end result is that for the same amount of fuel, many propulsion systems can be made exponentially more efficient and powerful - better missiles, aerospace craft and transport capability foremost - but the same technology also allows us to fine-tune some energy weaponry, as any thruster system worth attention is ultimately equally valuable as a weapon.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"
 tech_macro_ordnance_technology: "Breakthrough: Macro-Ordnance Technology"
 tech_macro_ordnance_technology_desc: "It has long been a common saying among empires that 'speed kills'. This is fairly obvious - a laser is proof enough of that, but in space any slug will keep going until it actually hits something without anything but the laws of physics to keep it that way.\n\nThe advent of hypersonic artillery - and Ceramo-Metal Kinetics - have allowed for some of the most powerful long-range artillery armatures in the history of our empire. A Kinetic Battery, for instance, fires slugs as such velocities that the sheer impact energy results in an effect on the target equivalent of the equal mass in high explosives (and a near miss is quite deafening to organics).\n\nOn the more extreme end of the spectrum is the Mega Cannon - a kinetic mass driver utilizing ordnance so enormous (the size of an Early Space Age Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) that the shockwave of it firing in atmosphere would result in plasma formation and weaker hurricane force winds being generated by the projectile's launch.\n\nIn both cases, however, the key issue behind using them for anything other than ship-to-ship combat has been three-fold - lack of ordnance that can handle atmospheric conditions and the G-forces involved, lack of sufficiently effective counter-recoil stabilizers to make full use of them and - in the case of the Mega Cannons - facilities that can actually house and fire the armatures without being annihilated in the process.\n\nNew research and development in multiple fields have found solutions to all three - resulting in extreme-range kinetic artillery for large vehicles and planetary defense facilities able to utilize a multitude of payloads. The Mega-Cannons, however, are more difficult - outside starships, they are relegated to supermassive bunker facilities with gargantuan stabilizers and an enormous radii cleared of any and all facilities due to the shockwaves of the weapon firing.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"

The end result is that a lot of production can be significantly improved in terms of production time, though overall cost and performance remains unchanged."
 tech_neutronium_composite_standardization: "Breakthrough: Neutronium Composite Standardization"
 tech_neutronium_composite_standardization_desc: "While not §Yactual§! Neutronium - in part because Neutronium is an extremely explosive fluidic material more dangerous than Anti-Matter due to Neutron Degeneracy and so heavy an individual armour frame forged from it would require a starship-sized reactor to at all move - Neutronium Materials have earned their namesake for their incredible density and incredible atomic-molecular strength and stability.\n\nThey are in fact older composites compressed to immense densities with previously unimaginable levels of chemical and structural stability - a single micron-thick layer equates a hundred times the thickness in Durasteel, yet has the mass of Durasteel only ten times that.\n\nThe application of the technology to our existing composites - from Starbase and Starship hulls to Strike Craft, Vehicle Armours and all the way down to circuitry - has an incredible impact on much of the materiel used by our empire, military or not.\n\nA simple exoskeletal framework for instance that is constructed from the Neutronium Composites equates ten times its thickness in Durasteel, but has within its framework sufficient circuits and mechanical systems to match a suit of armour made from Durasteel-based composites a hundred times the thickness and sufficient resilience to match a full-on Main Battle Vehicle constructed from our first-generation Nano-Composites.

 tech_neutronium_kinetics: "Breakthrough: Neutronium Kinetics"
 tech_neutronium_kinetics_desc: "As fascinating an idea as actual Neutronium Armatures would be, the reality is that a Neutronium Armature would be detrimental overall in its basic form; part because Neutronium is a fluidic substance, part because it is as volatile and destructive as Anti-Matter and part because an Armature made from actual Neutronium in even a primitive sidearm would have a total mass equivalent of the entire population of a primitive civilization.\n\nInstead, Neutronium as we know it is actually a form of extremely dense variation of our older composites with major alterations; the namesake of 'Neutronium' materials being their incredibly high atomic-molecular strength and overall stability, with a layer of Neutronium Materials performing on every level as something a hundred times its thickness in Durasteel, yet is only one-tenth the mass relative to the thickness.\n\nThis means that our Mass Drivers can now utilize armatures that are much, much smaller, yet can perform as if the armature was a hundred times the thickness. At the same mass as our older Durasteel Mass Drivers, this translates into performance equivalent of a much, much more massive Armature - allowing even greater acceleration.\n\nFor kinetic projectiles, the change is even greater. As Durasteel has been adapted into practically every corner of our kinetic weapons research, the end result is that a Mass Driver using Neutronium Armatures and Projectiles can now be made significantly smaller for the same mass, resulting in that exponentially more ammunition can be carried - and a Neutronium Slug will penetrate even the most durable Nano-Composites with incredible ease.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"

 tech_plasteel_kinetics: "Breakthrough: Plasteel Kinetics"
 tech_plasteel_kinetics_desc: "Plasteel - while highly useful for many material technologies - wasn't originally considered very useful for more advanced mass drivers; but that changed significantly after several smaller breakthroughs in regards to the materials that make up both the mass drivers and the projectiles themselves.\n\nPlasteel in its original form is a flexible, high-strength and more importantly cheap plastic-metal nano-composite that is as strong as the best nano-composite we can produce, but it is lighter than Ceramo-Metallic matrix materials. This means a lighter projectile, certainly, but also a very strong one that is far cheaper to deploy in bulk, meaning Plasteel projectiles can be deployed in enormous bulk for minimal change in cost.\n\nFor Mass Drivers, Plasteel isn't effective as an armature - but it is effective to reinforce the armatures, allowing the Ceramo-Metallic Armatures to be pushed to even greater energy levels as the risk of the surrounding barrel coming apart from the stresses of the weapon firing is now significantly mitigated.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"

 tech_pure_fusion_warheads: "Breakthrough: Pure Fusion Warheads"
 tech_pure_fusion_warheads_desc: "The advent of mass-producing - and containing - Anti-Matter has proven quite the boon for many military purposes. Unfortunately, there are a number of quite significant issues in regards to Anti-Matter Weapons in general; even the tiniest possible error equates an energy release that even Fusion cannot compete with - Anti-Matter, after all, annihilates itself in contact with any normal matter.\n\nThis isn't a significant problem for our warships - but storing and transporting pure Anti-Matter in bulk isn't logistically efficient (it requires enormous amounts of energy). Making use of the fundamentals behind Anti-Matter Warheads, however, is another thing altogether - specifically in the creation of Pure Fusion Warheads that do not make use of any fissile materials.\n\nThis has huge implications and uses for a myriad of purposes - many Fusion Weapons can now be scaled down to fit the size of some of the larger Anti-Armor Missiles employed with (highly relatively due to neutron radiation) clean yields, though several times greater than any fission warhead of equal size and mass.\n\nThis means that practically all our existing Fusion Warheads can be not only improved upon significantly, but also made significantly more powerful relative to their size.

 tech_quantum_warheads: "Breakthrough: Quantum Warheads"
 tech_quantum_warheads_desc: "Quantum Warheads - aka Zero-Point Warheads - are finicky but ultimately simplistic in nature. Very simply, a quantum warhead makes use of quantum phenomena to enhance its overall yield and effectiveness, but it also allows otherwise extremely volatile warheads to be made metastable to such a degree that even sabotage isn't guaranteed to set them off; made even more difficult with standardized Shield Modulator Systems.\n\nThis is a major step forward, as it allows for Anti-Matter storage on a massive scale with far less risk of accidental annihilation than before, though the risk is still there. It also allows for a very wide range of new and exotic warheads - how far one should push it depends on how inclined one happens to feel about accidental supernovas at the particular moment.\n\nBut it also allows for a final advance in Fusion Warheads utilizing stabilized monopoles. These warheads - known as Quantum-Conversion Warheads - are even more powerful than Anti-Matter Warheads (relatively speaking) due to a lot of the energy in AM-warheads escaping as Neutrinos, which are very weakly interacting (they pass right through most matter harmlessly).\n\nThe end result is Pure Fusion Warheads with yields equal to or greater to Anti-Matter ones - but with orders of magnitudes more stability, controllability and shelf-life, though the issue remains of scale due to the fact that controlling the reaction requires extensive advances in control technologies.\n\n\n§YCan be used to reshuffle tech cards.§!"

That is another matter altogether and ranges from 'striking with the effects of a fusion warhead' all the way up to 'subject of scientific research for centuries to come' with all the implications thereof.\n\nThe problem with such projectiles, however - moving at even fractions of light-speed - is quite obvious: for every action, an equal and opposite reaction, which means a relativistic cannon would (unless a Battleship or Titan hull) utterly annihilate itself from sheer recoil without a Plasma Armature to extend the 'rail' to several times the length of the hull.\n\nGenerating this in atmospheres has always been a bit of a problem - radiation aside, the armatures haven't been stable enough to function effectively outside a vacuum. That still applies, but the developments in plasma channel technology using lasers combined with superior (and much smaller) projectiles has now made it possible to implement projectiles of very impressive launch velocities, in addition to far better predictive fire control systems that increase their accuracy drastically.\n\nThe largest, the Ultra-Heavy Mass Cannon used for planetary defense, high-light the primary problems of the weapon batteries, however - they have to be placed in super-heavy bunker complexes with tele-operation from a secondary bunker complex that surrounds the Gun Bunkers due to the fact that firing the cannon causes minor earthquakes and shockwaves powerful enough to generate hurricane force winds.
