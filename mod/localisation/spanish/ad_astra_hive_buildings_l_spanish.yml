 building_adaptation_hive: "Adaptation Hive"
 building_adaptation_hive_desc: "The Adaptation Hive - a colossal and artificial mountain range of numerous Hives all tied together into a monumental web of Warrens, Launch Bays, Hangar Facilities, Spawning Pools, Gene-Forges, Hydroponics, Aeroponics, Nutrient Replicators, Research Facilities and specialized synaptic nodes, tying together a vast network of smaller outposts and facilities scattered throughout this world.\n\nThe Hive as a whole - aside from strengthening the Hive's coordination - is the core of large, specialized Hive Core that continually analyses and predicts the movements of drones to optimal effectiveness - adapting to the local conditions as required to achieve total dominance over the world in question."
 building_cynosural_link: "Cynosural Beacon"
 building_cynosural_link_desc: "Towering high above the stratosphere of the world below and narrowly touching the equivalent altitude of a mesosphere, the Cynosural Beacon is visible far and wide both across the entire world it sits on and across the entire system in question; the gigantic pillar of light that extends from the top of the Beacon harmless yet bright enough to be visible even from the farthest reaches of a system along its path - to those in orbit and on the surface, the Beacon shining like a small star.\n\nAt its heart is the obsidian core that constitutes a 'Cynosural Node'; a massive quantum-foam computing system of unfathomable power ... yet one that emits no detectable radiation and is - as far as any system can determine - impenetrable by any known means in every sense of the word, connected to 'The Infinity Network'.\n\nAll along the height of the Beacon, row on row of Brain Drones are connected to the Node - guarded and maintained as the greater spire around the Node works tirelessly - the entire spire drawing power not from generator grids - but from the Node itself as its energy output vastly exceeds the output of any single Generator District without any seemingly explainable source."
 building_cynosural_nexus: "Cynosural Nexus"
 building_cynosural_nexus_desc: "The size of an entire planetary continent, the Cynosural Nexus is by far one of the largest structures on this ringworld segment without question. It is so enormous, in fact, that it has its own set of ecosystems living amidst artificial mountain ranges consisting of a myriad of arcologies that all together form the greater observatory, consisting of hundreds of thousands of reactor complexes, research facilities, synapse nodes, landing pads, hive warrens and warrior hives.\n\nAt the core of the entire Nexus is the colossal Cynosural Node - a single, supermassive hive that rises high into the equivalent of a stratosphere, housing the many layers of the quantum-foam computing system that constitutes the Node as a whole, tapping into the 'Infinity Network' through indeterminate means and in turn converting this into usable data that can be interpreted by the perpetually connected Brain-Drones, who require constant assistance and occasional replacement.\n\nVisible far and wide in all directions and even from the edge of the system - the column of light it emits, like the computing system, is bizarre in nature. It emits no notable energy levels and the Node itself is impenetrable to any and all known means - physical or otherwise - though the nature of its obsidian structure remains ... very unclear, as it outputs significantly more energy than it actually consumes."
 building_deep_research_hives: "Deep Research Hives"
 building_deep_research_hives_desc: "A set of gargantuan hives tied together into a massive network that together form what can only be described as an artificial mountain range of composites, utilities, passageways and facilities - the Deep Research Hives makes use of countless dedicated Mental Drones, produced by the Hive Mind for the sole task of Research alone.\n\nWithin the Hives, warrens, energy facilities, specialized research facilities and finally spawning facilities all comprise the Hive's vast array of resources; all together, the Deep Research Hives continually feed the greater Hive Mind its accumulated knowledge and produces new Mental Drones to replace lost ones in the research pursuits, imprinting memory sequences from the old ones.\n\nThe Hives also house extensive synaptic amplifier facilities and long-range amplifier links to nearby warrens, allow the Hives to relay specific instructions in a semi-autonomous manner for matters of research and maintenance - including deep space links to autonomous satellite facilities in the interstellar void, consisting of large pre-spaceflight nation sized full-spectrum electromagnetic, gravitic and tachyon telescope arrays among them - that allow the Hive to delve into the greater Infinity Network."
 building_evolutionary_forge: "Evolutionary Forge"
 building_evolutionary_forge_desc: "By far one of the most gargantuan structures in the entirety of the world in question - the Evolutionary Forge reaches far into the stratosphere and even touching the very edges of the mesosphere. And yet despite such heights, the entirety of the Spire stands enveloped from its base to its peak in bio-mass - the single most massive vertical hive in the entirety of the world, bar none.\n\nWithin its boundaries, Habitat Facilities, Launch Bays, Hangar Facilities, Spawning Pools, Gene-Forges, Hydroponics, Aeroponics, Nutrient Replicators and Research Facilities constitute the bulk - yet hides the true power of the Spire. A massive cadre of Brain Drones, Synapse Drones and Hunter-Seeker that continually track, analyse and trim the massive logistical networks of the entire World and beyond with the support of the Spire itself - a single, gigantic Drone that is under the direct control of the Hive Mind with the bulk of its mass purely intended for mental operations.\n\nIn theory, the Forge could simulate the biospheres of any world in the entire galaxy down to a molecular level ... and potentially - beyond."
 building_expedition_vault: "Expedition Vault"
 building_expedition_vault_desc: "This massive facility is filled to its brim with scientists - foremost archaeologists - and all manner of experts in ancient history. Travelling out into the Relic World or following up leads on other worlds based on information gathered from the Relic World's records, new relics and information keeps flowing in at an incredible rate."
 building_forced_evolution_spires: "Forced Evolution Spires"
 building_forced_evolution_spires_desc: "In a relatively remote and heavily secured region of this world - behind a pre-spaceflight nation's worth of territory surrounding it, devoid of all but one massive layer of security systems and outposts after another - lies a mountain-sized set of Hive Spires, bristling with point-defences, gun batteries, shield generators and ship-grade armour.\n\nYet despite all that ... what is curious is that the way they are arranged do not seem to indicate that they are as much to keep something out ... as to keep something in.\n\n§YAllows building special armies from this world with corresponding technology.§!"
 building_foundry_hive: "Foundry Hive"
 building_foundry_hive_desc: "A massive high-density module packed to its brim with the most advanced manufacturing technologies available to the empire in question. Miner Shuttle Facilities, supermassive Zero-Gravity Foundries and Workshops in addition to smaller habitation facilities for the mining drones all together make it a critical piece in the habitat's manufacturing operations."
 building_greater_warrior_hive: "Greater Warrior Hive"
 building_greater_warrior_hive_desc: "An artificial mountain range of starship-grade composites, armor and shields under innumerable layers of various types of camouflage and artificial composite rock - the Greater Warrior Hive is an apt name for these linked Hive Cores that together form one of the largest Fortresses on this world.\n\nWhile largely self-sufficient in many ways, the Hive requires a steady supply-chain from the outside to maintain its gigantic defensive stockpiles and synaptic cores that monitor all activity across the entire hive colony for any sign of danger to the colony, while itself serving as a gigantic bunker complex.\n\nIts arsenal includes massed arrays of Point-Defence Weapons, Artillery Arrays, Theatre Shield Generators, Anti-Orbital Interception Weaponry, gigantic hangars with dropships and strike craft, colossal passive sensor arrays, bunker networks, emergency response nodes and forward operation nodes located throughout the entire colony. To take the world, an attack will have to engage the Hive.\n\nA task far easier said than done."
 building_hive_garden: "Hive Garden"
 building_hive_garden_desc: "The Hive Garden is an enormous array of structure - the size of an entire planetary continent - and so sprawling with such a monumental amount of biomass it qualifies as its own little piece of a Hive World. Nestled in or between the myriad of Hive Spires that together form the artificial mountain ranges of the Garden are hundreds of thousands of warrens, research facilities, geoponics, hydroponics and aeroponics facilities, landing and launch pads, warrior hives and spawning pools.\n\nAt the heart of the Garden is, however, is the most noticeable site of all: the Evolutionary Reactor. In reality an enormous spire to which genetically enhanced biomass has grown to make it appear like a single, gargantuan tree, rising up into stratospheric heights (something that, by all biological accounts, should be impossible) with it being every bit as verdant at the top as plant-life is at ground level.\n\nWithin the Reactor, even more warrens, Launch Bays, Hangar Facilities, bleeding edge Spawning Facilities, Gene-Forges, Hydroponics, Aeroponics, Nutrient Replicators and Research Networks constitute the bulk - yet hides the true power of the Reactor. A massive cadre of Brain-Drones, Synapse Drones and Hunter-Seeker Drones that continually track, analyse and trim the massive logistical networks of the entire Ringworld section and beyond with the aid of a supermassive network of interlinked and engineered Brain-Drones that are perpetually assisting in the Reactor's operations.\n\nIn theory, the Garden could simulate the biospheres of any world in the entire galaxy down to a molecular level ... and potentially - beyond."

 building_orbital_research_hive: "Orbital Research Hive"
 building_orbital_research_hive_desc: "A massive high-density module separated from the main habitat by dozens of airlocks, triple-reinforced blast doors (several layers in fact) and reinforced ultra-high security sections, the Orbital Research Hive brims with layer on layer of Brain Drones continually tending to the information flows of the entire Habitat, carefully coordinating and streamlining the flow to the greatest possible effect while at the same time combing over the information gleamed both from the laboratories on the Habitat and information coming in from other major research sites across the galaxy."
 building_orbital_synaptic_nexus: "Orbital Synaptic Nexus"
 building_orbital_synaptic_nexus_desc: "A massive high-density module packed to its brim with short and long-range synaptic interlinks using a combination of massive meganeurons transmitter webs and special synapse drones. Between them, the Synaptic Nexus rivals any Synaptic Cluster on its own, but serves the foremost purpose of immensely boosting the will and power of the greater hive mind across the habitat."
 building_orbital_war_hive: "Orbital War Hive"
 building_orbital_war_hive_desc: "Under continually heightened observation by the greater Hive Mind for any sign of deviancy or abnormality, the Orbital War Hive is the synaptic core that commands the habitat's defence grids, as well as housing a large dedicated facility to preparing new warrior drones.\n\nFrom here, a large number of different habitat defences can be deployed and controlled on a proverbial minute's notice - triple-reinforced blast doors, micro-shield generators, point-defence grids, sentry gun arrays, wall-integrated bunkers, chemical and 'vacuum' weapon arrays (specifically speaking venting a force into space is always an option) in addition to specially engineered drone strike units that excel in the defence of the habitat."
 building_starlift_foundry_hive: "Starlift Foundry Hive"
 building_starlift_foundry_hive_desc: "Visible far and wide - even easily from orbit - the Starlift Foundry is a hive of gargantuan proportions, reaching far into the stratosphere and very nearly touching the mesosphere equivalent of the world it rests upon. From its myriad launch pads and landing bays, entire pre-spaceflight continents worth of materiel leave and arrive to the Foundry each standard day.\n\nThe Foundry extends far beyond its visible parts, however. Deep down, the Foundry extends down to mantle depths for extraction and further expansion - and high above, either around the local star or around nearby stars, the Foundry controls massive arrays of continent-sized satellites that draw energy and matter from the stars to gradually convert into a vast range of usable elements.\n\nTo further production to even greater heights, the core facilities of the Foundry - hive warrens, manufacturing plants, hangars and warrior hives in addition to research and development facilities for Brain Drones - are all coordinated by the greater Hive Mind to streamline the greater industrial network of the system, making the facility a key piece in the greater logistical network."
 building_stellar_foundry_hive: "Stellar Foundry Hive"
 building_stellar_foundry_hive_desc: "Monumental in scale, the Stellar Foundry well and truly lives up to its name. The size of an entire planetary continent - tiny compared to the Ringworld segment - the Foundry's hundreds of thousands of reactor systems, research facilities, communication sites, habitat facilities, landing pads and warehouses all together forming artificial landscapes and mountain ranges of arcologies that even have their own climate.\n\nDeep below, into the very structure of the Ringworld section, the Stellar Foundry houses and coordinates enormous storage facilities of everything and anything required by the Hive Mind, and around the nearest star or in neighbouring star systems, coordinates gargantuan satellite swarms the size of small continents that gradually 'tap' nearby stars for raw materials - while the Foundry's own particle accelerators convert energy and light elements into heavier ones for use in various purposes."
 building_swarm_core: "Swarm Core"
 building_swarm_core_desc: "The Swarm Core is by far one of the most massive fortress complexes on this ringworld segment. The size of an entire planetary continent, the City is in practice one gargantuan Fortress complex, consisting of a myriad of Hive Spires that together form enormous artificial mountain ranges constructed from starship-grade composites and starship-grade shielding rendering orbital bombardment more difficult.\n\nIn and between the spires are hundreds of thousands of warrens the city of hive districts, hangar bays large enough to rival Starbase Citadels, anti-orbital interception grids with actual starship weapons, passive sensor array grids that monitor everything in-system, rapid repair and deployment mega-facilities, synaptic spires and emergency response facilities of every kind.\n\nThis combined with warrior spawning spires the size of entire regions - allowing specialized growth and adaptations to pretty much every kind of environment without leaving the Ringworld - results in more well-adapted and effective forces leaving the Ringworld. To take the segment, forces will have to engage the Core first. A task easier said than done."
 building_synaptic_link: "Synaptic Link"
 building_synaptic_link_desc: "The Synaptic Link is a gigantic complex - in effect the size of a primitive megacity all on its own - and is among the single largest synaptic hive nodes on this world. Within its gargantuan weave of roiling protoplasmic fibers, interlinked with FTL communication relays that strengthens and coordinates the Hive Mind of this world, the Synaptic Link continually experiments with new methods of micro-adjustments to reduce the overall necessary comforts required by Drones on this world without detrimental effect."
 building_synaptic_nexus: "Synaptic Nexus"
 building_synaptic_nexus_desc: "This awe-inspiring megalith - stretching high into the stratospheric altitudes and touching the very edges of the equivalent mesosphere - is the single most powerful Synaptic Hive on this world, bar none. Divided into many separate layers and smaller surrounding satellite hives - each the size of a pre-Spaceflight megacity - the Nexus houses in each of its gargantuan layers a massive Hive of its own with the height from 'floor' to 'roof' being sufficient for each layer to have even its own atmospheric conditions that must be managed by the Drones.\n\nAll the way, protoplasmic fiber weaves the width of Corvettes run up and down the entire length of the Nexus, with countless hundreds of millions of Synaptic Drones interlinked to the Nexus to form a massive amplifiers for the greater Hive Mind. Through it, the will of The Mind becomes all but absolute and all but omni-present."
 building_tectonic_hive: "Tectonic Hive"
 building_tectonic_hive_desc: "The Tectonic Hive is a massive set of warrens all tied together to form what can be only described as a gigantic artificial volcano of composites, utilities, passageways, nests, recycling centres, forges and foundries - at its heart, the massive Tectonic Forge that gives the foundry its namesake; a colossal Mohole that reaches to depths much closer to the outer core of a world - far, far deeper than any other extraction centre and capable of far greater extraction rate than any other mining facility on this world.\n\nBut just as the Tectonic Forge delves deep into the world below - rising high above and far away from the Forge is the colossal Launch Relay; a Launch Loop structure that is large enough to allow the launch of even Corvette-mass vessels with ease; millions of units of cargo entering and leaving every standard hour with warehouses in standby to load and unload the colossal volumes of cargo it entails.\n\nAll this is coordinated from the Foundry itself - among its many facilities, a cadre of Synaptic Drones coordinate the efforts not just of the Foundry as a whole - but throughout the entire world in question, making the Foundry effectively among the single greatest mining and logistics hubs on this world."
 building_uni_link_hive: "Uni-Link Hive"
 building_uni_link_hive_desc: "This gigantic complex - the size of an entire planetary continent - is the single largest Synaptic Hive on this Ringworld segment. Gargantuan in scale, its immense myriad of hive spires together form entire mountain ranges, consisting of innumerable numbers of smaller Hive Districts and amplifiers for the Hive Mind.\n\nAll throughout the Uni-Link Hive, Synaptic Hives, Warrior Hives and innumerable Maintenance Drone Hives all operate together as a single form with all but fluid efficiency - the greater Hive itself serving as a place of shelter for the Drones that both make up the Hive and a means of testing new and improved methods of sheltering Drones and keeping the necessary comforts while also reducing the amount of resources required to achieve as such.\n\nThrough the Hive Halls large enough to land Corvettes, the endless numbers of the Hive perform their tasks. If ever there was a place where the Hive Mind was at its absolute strongest, it would undoubtedly be within the Uni-Link Hive."
 building_warrior_core: "Warrior Core"
 building_warrior_core_desc: "The Warrior Core rises high above the surface of the world below - a titanic fortress that stretches far into the equivalent stratosphere and nearly to the edge of the mesosphere of this world, though the true bulk of it is buried deep below the surface, encompassing an area only known to the Hive Mind itself and with the by comparison tiny spire rising above the mass below.\n\nThis spire - constructed from starship grade composites, arrayed with massive shield generators, gargantuan hangar bays, launch facilities, point-defence grids, anti-orbital interception grids, passive sensor array grids, rapid repair and deployment facilities, synaptic amplifier cores and enormous warrens with warrior drones, is a statement of complete and utter defiance on the part of the greater Hive Mind that constructed it.\n\nTo take the world, the Warrior Core must be destroyed or taken. Easier said than done."
 building_wyrmguard_citadel_hive: "Hybrid Spawn Spire"
 building_wyrmguard_citadel_hive_desc: "The Hybrid Spawn Spire. This gigantic Hive Spire - rising high into the world's equivalent of a stratosphere and touching the very edges of its mesosphere - is by far one of the largest buildings of this world; a mountain of starship grade armour and shields, bristling from its base to its peaks with point-defence weaponry, anti-orbital interception cannons, artillery and hangars large enough to house Corvettes.\n\nThose same hangars now serve as the warrens of the greatest weapon this gargantuan fortress has, however - the Wyrmguard. The Drakes, born from specialized warrior drones and deployed alongside strike units of Gene-Warriors patrol the skies of this world from the Spire in large aerospace carriers or atop the backs of the great Drake Drones.\n\nIn the Spire itself, breeding facilities, synaptic cores, habitat warrens, support drone facilities, research laboratories of every kind and manufacturing facilities that produce some of the most high quality equipment the empire can afford make up the core of the Spire - in addition to perfecting the tactics, doctrines and drones behind them; gradually improving upon everything from weapons, shields, armour technologies to tactics, strategies, logistics and overall designs over time.\n\nIn order to engage the Spire - the only effective recourse is to shatter the world it rests upon. Even then, that is not a guarantee.\n\n§YAllows building special armies from this world with corresponding technology.§!"

 tech_adaptive_hive_cores: "Adaptive Hive Cores"
 tech_adaptive_hive_cores_desc: "In the years since the creation of the first Adaptation Hive, its success of improving the Hive's overall conditions on many worlds goes without saying. Yet as the Hive expands, there remains significant room for expansion.\n\nIn studying other life-forms, in particular spacefaring, there have been telling and indeed intriguing patterns in their otherwise chaotic and unpredictable behaviour - repeating patterns in their histories that, with effort, can be used to predict the future actions of other life-forms; referred to as 'Psychohistorical Theory' and 'Predictive Pattern Recognition'.\n\nCombined with a strengthened and dedicated interlinking of the individual Adaptive Hives to share and implement solutions on various worlds through the greater Hive Mind, semi-Autonomous agents predict significantly improved performance. The issue is volume; the necessary Neuro-Synaptic Transmitters need to be far larger, require exceptional room and Drones to tend to them.\n\nIt would not work on normal worlds. But there are exceptions to this ..."
 tech_adaptive_hive_networks: "Adaptive Hive Networks"
 tech_adaptive_hive_networks_desc: "Since the rise of the Hive to the stars, the Hive's myriad colonies have been - to one extent or another - challenged by the new and hostile worlds to be subdued. All from structures to food and medicine among others to maintain the drones vary greatly from world to world - resulting in a requirement for new an adaptive measures.\n\nNew mutations and adaptive measures are required to optimize the Hive's position as the apex life-form in the galaxy. No longer can limited specialized drone clusters be sufficient to achieve the necessary objectives of the Hive. More is required.\n\nTo this end, the Brain Drones have developed an advancement - new, specialized Hive Clusters dedicated solely to the task of adaptation, mutation, evolution. The Adaptation Hives will be critical to our final objective."
 tech_adaptive_war_hives: "Adaptive War Hives"
 tech_adaptive_war_hives_desc: "As the Hive grows and its myriad worlds expand, requirements have evolved in accordance. The defence of a world on the scale such as Hive Worlds require more than mere strongholds and fortresses - it requires unimaginable numbers of Warrior Drones and Hunter-Seeker Drones to both maintain the cohesion of the greater Hive and to defend its countless myriad tunnels and networks from attack on a scale the Hive can scarcely remember.\n\nEvery opening, every tunnel, every single spire and so onwards creates issues in both directions - a collapsed hive spire causes mass devastation in all directions all around it being the final and most notable issue on sufficient scale. Lessons learned by the Hive Mind from our Warrior Hives now allow the Mind to imagine a new set of solutions - alterations to the existing Greater Warrior Hives to become all-encompassing fortresses.\n\nThe Brain-Drones have created the reference 'Warrior Core' to this design."
 tech_dread_hive_mutations: "Dread Hive Mutations"
 tech_dread_hive_mutations_desc: "Our knowledge of Genetic Engineering is vast - what was once impossible a century ago is now simplicity itself. One such example is the creation of the Xenomorph - a powerful bio-weapon that when unleashed in number can lay waste to entire worlds.\n\nIn the modern age, however, it is rivalled by many others. We can do much more. Go much further. By implementing Xenomorph strands with advanced cybernetics and new generations of genetic augmentations in addition to cladding them in powerful armour frameworks, a new generation of xenomorph is created that are supremely efficient in their tasks - the Reaver.\n\nBy implementing specialized Synapse Drones to override the will of the Reavers, it might be possible to implement the mutations into specialized Drone forms - hybrid Warrior Drones that are specifically vicious, adaptable and expandable. There is a concern in the Hive Mind about such a path ... but why would that be a hindrance?"
 tech_orbital_war_hives: "Orbital War Hives"
 tech_orbital_war_hives_desc: "Defending an orbital station from invasion is another task entirely from defending a planet in many ways, and requires radical rethinking on a large scale in regards to how combat is to be conducted to maximize effect and minimize damage to the habitat in question. Creating effective synaptic command and control in zero-gravity combat, enhancing habitat point-defence networks, command and control systems for damage control and close-quarters point-defence and sector lockdown, may allow for a more efficient defensive force with a higher standard of overall effectiveness aboard our habitats."
 tech_starlift_operations_hive: "Starlifting Operations"
 tech_starlift_operations_hive_desc: "Contrary to the general belief of many pre-FTL civilizations, the vast majority of building materials in a starsystem are not found in the planets or the asteroids - but rather, the supermajority is located inside the most inhospitable place possible; the star or stars of a system - with a regular G-type Main Sequence Star (Yellow Dwarf) having more Carbon and Iron than an entire planet's combined mass several hundred times over and its energy a resource in itself for particle accelerators to synthetize heavier elements.\n\nIn essence, Starlifting - a technique to extract material from a star - means an effectively inexhaustible supply of raw basic materials on level with literally building entire worlds and still having enough to build several hundred more from a single star.\n\nThe biggest problem in this equation, however, is energy - our starbases can already handle the proximity to a star fairly well, but extracting raw materials from a star in bulk is quite another challenge altogether, needing virtually every field of engineering to step up twice over. It will be difficult to pull off - but success equates virtually unlimited resources for billions of years to come."
 tech_streamlined_megaproduction_hive: "Streamlined Mega-Production"
 tech_streamlined_megaproduction_hive_desc: "Since the earliest days of our exploration of the galaxy, mining into the mantles of worlds has been one of the most common - and quite profitable - ventures outside asteroid mining to ensure a steady and easy supply of raw minerals for the greater Hive. Yet ... the Hive has come to hit a fundamental issue that was in a way, unforeseen: our logistical ability, while significant, isn't as optimized as it can be.\n\nSpecifically, the issue lies in that while off-world logistics are quite easily handled by the system starbase, on and off-world logistics are hampered by the fact that SSTO technology has specific limitations in terms of bulk transportation, meaning a lot of resources already processed end up in storage until they can be transported off-world.\n\nTogether with a proposal to enhance our near-core mining technology, Brain-Drones Agents have proposed an all-encompassing solution to these specific sets of problems in the form of a dedicated Mining and Logistics Cluster - the Tectonic Hive."

 tech_synaptic_beacons_desc: "With continual expansion efforts of the greater Hive Mind, issues have begun to arise - Drones either unable to properly respond or even outright refusing to respond to the Mind's commands as a result of the will of the Mind not reaching or not getting through in sufficient strength.\n\nThis is not an issue for the Drones themselves for the most part - but rather, an issue of signals weakening and the will of the Hive Mind not reaching as far as it should. A solution to this, created by a dedicated Brain Node, has been proposed to the Hive Mind as a potential route. A massive, meganeuron network relay that is interlinked to others of its kind, entangled through FTL communication webs and reinforcing the will of the Hive Mind.\n\nIt is referred to as the Synaptic Link."
 tech_synaptic_hive_core: "Synaptic Hive Cores"
 tech_synaptic_hive_core_desc: "The development of the Synaptic Links have - in general - proven successful. The strengthening of the greater Hive Mind has been noticeable, yet there remains room for evolution and improvement. The recent breakthroughs made by the Hive offers new potential solutions to the expansion issues in the form of a new, supermassive Synaptic Hive Core, dedicated to reinforcing the will of the Hive Mind across worlds with far greater Drone capacity."
 tech_the_infinity_network_hive: "The Infinity Network"
 tech_the_infinity_network_hive_desc: "As the Hive delves deeper into the Cynosural Realm, drones now lost have made significant strides towards understanding the underlying principles - the basic nature - of it, through the aid of the strange 'ghosts' that inhabit it and are willingly communicating with the Hive, the Hive Mind sees opportunity and potential.\n\nThe development of a new and super-massive 'relay' that is capable of piercing deeper into the Infinity Network has been part of this potential; yet the materials required are strange in their nature and the space they require beyond most worlds to sustain as the number of Drones required to maintain a steady link exceeds that of even our most densely populated worlds.\n\nControl and filtration of the incoming information aside, there are enormous engineering challenges presented to the Hive Mind to achieve the ultimate goal of discovering the secret of the Cynosural Realm. Before now, it was impossible due to the scales involved.\n\nBut now, with the major breakthroughs in macro-scale engineering, that has changed dramatically. The Hive Mind prepares to reach for the Cynosural Realm ... and all the knowledge that lies within its boundaries."
 tech_unified_research_hives: "Unified Research Hives"
 tech_unified_research_hives_desc: "The Hive's never-ending pursuit of knowledge is paramount to expansion. Unfortunately, the Hive's greater mental capacity faces bottlenecks and limitations of Drone mental capacity as the Hive can only perform as effectively as the weakest Mental Drone. Yet as the Hive grows, expands, evolves ... it has encountered something outside of known predictions. An anomaly.\n\nSpecifically, a form of 'web', 'weave' or 'network' of deeply connected Dark Matter and possibly even Dark Energy.\n\nThe Hive refers to it as 'The Infinity Network' or 'The Cynosural Realm' - this 'network' exists in a form that we cannot properly describe, seemingly connecting together through the Dark Matter, Dark Energy and dimensional layers previously unknown to us, potentially forming an entirely separate dimension altogether. The network might even span the entire universe, but we have no certain way of knowing.\n\nWhat we do know, is that the 'network' isn't empty - it is full of strange entities, powerful and intelligent beyond even the ability of our greatest minds to understand. Most are aloof, completely uncaring of our comings and goings - yet a few are communicative and open to us, albeit in their own strange ways.\n\nThese 'ghosts' as they are dubbed by us allow us to tap into the network, albeit to a very limited extent; though in order to understand the data we collect, however limited, we require new and far more advanced facilities. The Hive seeks knowledge. It will develop the means to acquire it."
 tech_war_hives: "War Hives"
 tech_war_hives_desc: "Over the many years since we began our expansion into space, we have come to face both opportunities and threats. The galaxy - for all its incredible aspects - has a darker side that has time and again forced us to push ourselves and our defences harder than anything we have ever done in the Hive's known memory.\n\nAnd from those same events and the lessons learned thereof - the Hive Mind has come to develop a new and more powerful form of warren ... a Hive Core on its own - dedicated solely to our Warriors."
 tech_world_scale_war_hives: "World-Scale War Hives"
 tech_world_scale_war_hives_desc: "The development of increasingly larger and more complex militarized facilities is a never-ending pursuit in order to achieve the ultimate goal of a fortress that can defend worlds from any type of attack. Yet in this pursuit, a fundamental issue has cropped up - specifically, how to create an effective defensive fortress for something as colossal as a Ringworld.\n\nThe Ringworld in itself is hard enough - a single segment having more usable territory than an entire planetary system combined which means far more territory to patrol and safeguard - but coordinating the entirety of the segment's defensive operations is an even greater challenge due to the scale involved.\n\nYet for all the challenges involved, there are also incredible opportunities. A Ringworld is enormous. What would be far too massive for any normal world to handle in terms of sheer scale becomes a joke in practice to even one segment's worth of space.\n\nThe Brain Drones have started to think big. Very big.\n\nWell ... small-scale big, anyway."
 tech_xenodraconian_mutations: "Xenodraconian Mutations"
 tech_xenodraconian_mutations_desc: "We hold in our possession the genetic code for the Ether Drake. The Hive Mind's Brain Drones express uncertainty, due to the difficult of replicating an entity from another universe which survived conditions beyond the Hive's most optimistic estimates. There is also doubt, concern ... in the sense that we could potentially bring about the end of The Hive. That we simply cannot create biological beings of such a scale and complexity is also a matter of fact, unfortunately ... which is why we start small and force mutate drones with the genetic code."
