 sword_of_the_stars_modifier_desc: "Increases all damage against Leviathans, Space Monsters and Endgame Threats by §G+2%§!."
 tech_adaptive_battle_programming: "Adaptive Battle Programming"
 tech_adaptive_battle_programming_desc: "From the earliest recorded instances of combat operations, the Network has been continually developing new warfare algorithms and improved programming for combat drones. The process has, however, been slow and inherently problematic on account of the innumerable unforeseen variables in each successive engagement, resulting in significant issues adapting accordingly on a tactical and ultimately, strategic level beyond our baseline performance.\n\nTo this end, the Drone Combat Algorithms and Programming systems must be optimized. By concentrating the data gathered during combat engagements - in space and on worlds - new adaptive combat programming can be implemented alongside Drone Hardware more easily tailored to the local conditions and requirements.\n\nThe end result is a highly adaptive combat force that can more rapidly and easily integrate combat data into usable combat network links, resulting in a superior ship intelligence or combat force."
 tech_adaptive_force_training: "Adaptive Force Training"
 tech_adaptive_force_training_desc: "Warfare is a complicated business - training even more so. There is an old saying that victory is achieved before battle rather than in it; that for every hundred units of energy spent in training, a thousand units of resources can be saved in mending forces.\n\nTo this end, taking what is learned in the battlescapes throughout the galaxy and making that knowledge part of new and superior training - in addition to boosting the rate at which our armed forces learn and adapt - we can greatly improve the overall skill and ability of crews and forces as they put training into practice.\n\nExperience is the best teacher - and if we can turn that teacher to our side true and proper, victory will go to us ... for we have the best trained forces in the galaxy when all is said and finally done."
 tech_ascendant_engineering: "Ascendant Engineering"
 tech_ascendant_engineering_desc: "The weaves and strands of technology is more than a mere language - but a code, a cipher that we have come to understand even more so than most of our senses. They won't understand it, of course, but that's to be expected."
 tech_beacon_of_the_galaxy: "Beacon of the Galaxy"
 tech_beacon_of_the_galaxy_desc: "We have chosen to shoulder a heavy duty in regards to the galaxy at large. Regardless what others may think of us - and we of them - we cannot carry out our mission if others will not trust us.\n\nTo this end, the formation of a Corps dedicated to the task is needed - excelling in diplomacy and missions of peacekeeping and the aid of sapient and sentient life by the jurisdiction and directive we have given them; in effect, acting as a force on our behalf across the galaxy, they will be a beacon that shall shine as bright as the stars themselves."
 tech_bulwark_of_worlds: "Bulwark of Worlds"
 tech_bulwark_of_worlds_desc: "There is no biomes which stands in our way - no challenge too great, nothing beyond our reach to settle; mountains, swamps, glaciers, wastelands, oceans, jungles - even volcanoes, subterranean regions and landscapes packed with the most ferocious wildlife poses no challenge, with our cities and fortresses melding into and becoming one with the world around them, harnessing the world to its fullest potential and utilizing its natural defenses and characteristics to even greater heights through superior technology and ecological understanding. Our mastery is absolute - and with it, the worlds themselves will become the shields to guard them."
 tech_empire_of_stars: "Empire of Stars"
 tech_empire_of_stars_desc: "We stand upon the brink of a new age - of a new empire not of one, but many. We are many civilizations, many empires under one banner, one path. We must learn, grow and expand - to open up new roads of communication and technological sharing. We share a common destiny - and beyond, a common future."
 tech_executive_force: "Executive Force"
 tech_executive_force_desc: "The edicts we proclaim must be enforced with vigor and efficiency. That will take effort and thought on how to achieve with efficiency. But it can be done. It will be done."
 tech_fortress_systems: "Fortress Systems"
 tech_fortress_systems_desc: "There are many who would see our empire in ruin and all that we have forged under iron clasp. When that time comes, our enemies will find that we have not been idle. Throughout our systems, thousands upon thousands of hidden defensive platforms - from sensor platforms the size of small boulders, ever unassuming - to hidden gun batteries of every kind awaiting command.\n\nLet them come one at a time or all at once. It matters not.\n\nNone shall pass."
 tech_galactica_mandate: "The Galactica Mandate"
 tech_galactica_mandate_desc: "The borders of our empire are always in flux; as concrete as they may be today, they may not be tomorrow. We must reinforce our border worlds, and through every method and means ensure that our borders remain secure."
 tech_imperial_union: "Imperial Union"
 tech_imperial_union_desc: "Many and varied are the worlds under our control - but the connection between each and every one of them remains limited. Establishment of more efficient transportation and communication networks - with all the benefits and costs it brings with as a result - may allow for closer knit colonies."
 tech_master_of_worlds: "Master of Worlds"
 tech_master_of_worlds_desc: "A world is not so different from a very massive space station in practice. It's all a matter of making all the pieces connect in perfect harmony, to mold the very world in just the right ways, to make it all come together like pieces of a gigantic puzzle. Our knowledge may bring about a new era of life for all life in the galaxy."
 tech_mega_engineering_corps: "Mega-Engineering Corps"
 tech_mega_engineering_corps_desc: "Civilizations come, civilizations go. Their legacy, however, remains - and our skill in the field of macro-engineering stands an eternal testament to that. Yet we can do so much more, so much better. Our original Corps of Naval Engineers, once dedicated to the task of creating the best space stations possible, may be expanded upon - dedicated to make the task of building megastructures on scales that would baffle other civilizations as simple as building a starbase. It's time to forge a legacy that will stand the test of time."
 tech_mind_above_all: "Mind-Above-All"
 tech_mind_above_all_desc: "The Hive Mind encompasses all. Each form - warrior, worker, leader, researcher - has its place, purpose, knowledge. All flows into the Mind and from the Mind, this knowledge can be imparted again into each individual drone, specifically tailored to its purpose and need. With each new experience, every new path and every new discovery, every single drone in the entirety of the Hive Mind grows - as one mind, we gradually grow into something beyond our meager beginnings.\n\nWe are becoming singular. And with that, we grow stronger."
 tech_phase_drives: "Phase Drives"
 tech_phase_drives_desc: "While Fusion-thruster technology has come far over the years, we have yet to achieve the ultimate goal of sublight travel - the speed of light. In addition to time dilation being an issue with such enormous velocities, not to mention impacts equivalent to Anti-Matter Weaponry, the facts are that our best thruster technology simply isn't up to the task yet. To solve this, our researchers have worked on an addition to our thruster systems, called the Phase Drive, which utilizes various technologies to allow vessels and craft to accelerate and decelerate from extreme velocities safely. Refining the technology, however, will take time; but in theory, the only limit to the Phase Drives is the speed of light itself."
 tech_photonic_molecular_assembly: "Photonic Molecular Assembly"
 tech_photonic_molecular_assembly_desc: "Photonic Molecules - or literally molecules made of light, alternatively and more realistically light bonded to molecules - sounds much like an improbable theory. Impossible, even, from a realistic perspective. At least, we thought that once. When it became a proven fact that we could, in fact, produce actual hard physical objects with whatever characteristics we so required from actual 'Hard Light' structures, the implications were immense.\n\nWhile we are not quite there yet in actually creating permanent structures made from photonic molecules, the use of semi-permanent and even long-term stable chains allows us to in theory create whatever we want at extreme speeds with extreme precision and effectiveness, serving as scaffolds and frameworks that help reduce build time on many engineered materials that require precision manufacturing. The implications are staggering. This is a technology that has to be refined to its maximum potential."
 tech_rapid_battle_mutations: "Rapid Battle Mutations"
 tech_rapid_battle_mutations_desc: "As the Hive expands and evolves, it inevitably faces new and unpredictable challenges in each and every engagement. Warrior Drones can be bred with an innate ability to fight, yet they remain only as potent as their equipment and the skills imprinted upon them.\n\nTo this end, the Hive Mind must enter into the fray - take all that has been gleamed and learned from the many battlescapes of the galaxy and concentrate and refine it into knowledge that can be imprinted onto existing and new generations of drones, as well as introduce new and more significant mutation keys in the drones that survive the battles.\n\nThe end result is that for every engagement, the surviving Drones will evolve into new and more superior forms. Little by little, growing larger, stronger, faster and more interconnected with the greater Hive Mind. The end result is a greater, more powerful Warrior Form - and with more research, one unrivalled."
 tech_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency Enhancements"
 tech_resource_efficiency_desc: "The resources of the galaxy - while certainly vast - are by no means infinite. While there is only so much that can be done realistically, major research investments into topological optimization, resource recycling, refinement, durability improvements, renewable resources and elimination of wasteful toxic fuels, we can greatly improve the resource efficiency of our empire on a massive scale - reducing the resource requirements across a wide spectrum."
 tech_self_repair_protocols: "Self-Repair Protocols"
 tech_self_repair_protocols_desc: "Utilizing a combination of nanotechnology, drones, onboard fabricators units, ultra-high efficiency self-sustainment technology, training and administrative AI systems, our vessels and forces can in theory operate solo without any help or resupply from our worlds for massively extended periods of time. To refine the necessary protocols, training and technology will take a great deal of time, however, but remains doable."
 tech_self_repair_protocols_synthetic: "Self-Repair Protocols"
 tech_self_repair_protocols_synthetic_desc: "Utilizing a combination of nanotechnology, drones, onboard fabricators units, ultra-high efficiency self-sustainment technology and efficiency-enhancement subsystems, our vessels and forces can in theory operate solo without any help or resupply from our worlds for massively extended periods of time. To refine the necessary protocols and technology will take a great deal of time, however, but remains doable."
 tech_star_drive: "Star Drives"
 tech_star_drive_desc: "Star Bridges, also known as Stellar Tubes, was for the longest time only a theory. In its simplicity, the Star Bridges very simply generate something akin to Wormholes or 'Tunnels' which connects Point A to Point B using a large portal, allowing for extremely rapid travel. Making the technology work with our current FTL systems is quite a challenge, and refining them even more so. But in theory, these drives can theoretically allow us to cross anywhere in the galaxy ... and possibly, beyond."
 tech_strength_of_unity: "Strength of Unity"
 tech_strength_of_unity_desc: "Under one vision, our empire stands tall. Through unity, we gain strength, meaning - and ultimately, we reach towards the stars with all but absolute resolve, for we shall not falter nor fall."
 tech_sword_of_the_stars: "Sword of the Stars"
 tech_sword_of_the_stars_desc: "Forces array at the galaxy from all sides. One enemy after the other seeks to destroy us and all other life. They come one at a time or all at once. They will find this as far as they shall ever go. We will learn. Adapt. Overcome and ultimately - conquer.\n\nWe will be as steadfast as the tower that does not bend to the storm - for courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it."
 tech_synchronized_gigascale_databanks: "Synchronized Gigascale Databanks"
 tech_synchronized_gigascale_databanks_desc: "The Network has expanded significantly since the first days of expansions. Since the beginning, countless Yottabytes of data have been collected through individual drones and data networks - and countless more are streaming in still. The raw data is useful for research, production, combat, exploration in limited scope. This is wasteful, inefficient. It is an inherent error.\n\nSpecialized sub-processor units dedicated to the task of processing all data into usable scientific, production, tactical, strategic and analysis databanks that hold all resultant operational modifications special-tailored for each individual platform equate superior units overall. The inefficiency of the Network must be managed."
 tech_the_grand_academy: "The Grand Academy"
 tech_the_grand_academy_desc: "It is claimed that knowledge is the key to the universe. True enough. But translating that knowledge into something usable is quite a bit of a challenge.\n\nMassively expanding upon our educational system - advanced psychological understanding, ultra-realistic simulations, streamlined training regimes, enhanced memory techniques, individual-to-individual tailored education and so on and on and on - all serves to create a solid foundation of knowledge that can easily be easily accessed and learned, making a new generation of citizens of exceptional skill - the best and brightest of all candidates drawn to the Grand Academy of our empire, where the leaders of tomorrow are made."
